The operator had sustained an injury to their arm. Initial investigations indicated a possible issue with the RRV because one of the front wheels was 2 inches of the rail. The fitter reported that everything was working fine with self-levelling of the wheels, but it could be seen that when the machine was heading back to ""off track"" the wheel still wasn’t touching the rail and got stuck and couldn’t move. Even when the machine was stable and ready to ""off track"", the wheel was not touching the rail by 20mm. If the self-levelling part of the machine was working, the wheel that was in the air should have been touching the head of the rail. There was no damage to any off the track because it only travelled about 30 to 50 meters.",Non-severe,0.001

I am not coming in tonight as I had a accident last night at WBP. My job was to scope the whole WBP area for ballast work with my principal XXXXXXX. Because of rain we cancelled our job as we couldn't see the dusty ballast for voids. As it was raining then we decided to help XXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXX with their BVI-24, loose and missing clips and removal of lane 6 signs from WB. After finishing all the jobs, myself and XXXX picked up the signs from turnback A and started walking back to ROP. On the way back I saw few lids were off from the troffins next to turnback A and decided to put them back on for everyone's safety. XXXXXXX and I made them safe. As XXXXX(ODM) as Lookout and XXX (COSS) witness this as they were walking behind us. Then I picked up the sign and started walking again and few metres away, my left foot went through another troffin which looked visibly fine to walk over while carrying the sign which was little heavy. When I fell down and my left knee landed on the ballast. On that moment it was sore and I had bleeding. We walked back and cleared the work site. We returned to Plumstead and after finishing my shift when I went home and took my PPE off then I saw my PPE was covered with blood and by then it was painful. I bandaged it, took few pain killers, and went to sleep. When I woke up my knee was stiff and painful as it is internal injury. So, I will be resting my knee. Can you please put this in the accident book for me and forward me the copy as well. I have informed my seniors as well. Thanks.",Severe 7,0.01
