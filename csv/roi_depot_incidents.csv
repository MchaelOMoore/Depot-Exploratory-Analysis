The operator had sustained an injury to their arm. Initial investigations indicated a possible issue with the RRV because one of the front wheels was 2 inches of the rail. The fitter reported that everything was working fine with self-levelling of the wheels, but it could be seen that when the machine was heading back to ""off track"" the wheel still wasn’t touching the rail and got stuck and couldn’t move. Even when the machine was stable and ready to ""off track"", the wheel was not touching the rail by 20mm. If the self-levelling part of the machine was working, the wheel that was in the air should have been touching the head of the rail. There was no damage to any off the track because it only travelled about 30 to 50 meters.",South Western Railway,South Western Railway
