The operator had sustained an injury to their arm. Initial investigations indicated a possible issue with the RRV because one of the front wheels was 2 inches of the rail. The fitter reported that everything was working fine with self-levelling of the wheels, but it could be seen that when the machine was heading back to ""off track"" the wheel still wasn’t touching the rail and got stuck and couldn’t move. Even when the machine was stable and ready to ""off track"", the wheel was not touching the rail by 20mm. If the self-levelling part of the machine was working, the wheel that was in the air should have been touching the head of the rail. There was no damage to any off the track because it only travelled about 30 to 50 meters."

A plan was formulated by the RfLI Service & Infrastructure Manager (SIM) to send an empty rescue train to draw alongside 9R14 via Turnback A and carry out an indirect train-to-train transfer of the approx 1000 passengers on board. The rescue train (with approx 14 railway staff on board) arrived on Turnback A at 20:10. The rescue party observed a train ahead and incorrectly thought that this was 9R14 and made their way to the train. This was in fact 9T12, which the rescue party commenced detraining. On returning towards the rescue train at approx 2210, the party observed passengers approaching from 9R14 who had self-evacuated from the train. The rescue party, then realised that they had not noticed 9R14 and commenced detraining this train to Westbourne Park Road Rail Access Point."""

Immediately, enquires were done to discover the cause. After conversations and discussions with various stakeholders, it was determined that the FDS4 measuring equipment on the Robel had encounter the Live wire when the Robel was traveling to the site of work. The equipment has a separate Pentagraph which is reported to be allowed to raise up to 1 meter away from the overhead line equipment to conduct measuring. The operator raised the Pentagraph fully, connecting with the live OLE causing a trip which resulted in the flash. It has been reported that all the measuring equipment connected to the Robel is damaged and not fit for use. It was then decided to keep the electricity off and return the Robel back into the maintenance 09 road to berth. Once the machine was berthed and clear, actions were taken to inspect the damage caused to the infrastructure. The OLE such as wires, structures, droppers, and rail was all assessed from the OLE track technician. It was confirmed to only have minor dis-colourisation but no concerns to for normal operations of the railway thereafter. All staff involved were stood down and cause for screening followed.

I am not coming in tonight as I had a accident last night at WBP. My job was to scope the whole WBP area for ballast work with my principal XXXXXXX. Because of rain we cancelled our job as we couldn't see the dusty ballast for voids. As it was raining then we decided to help XXXX XXXXXX and XXXXXX with their BVI-24, loose and missing clips and removal of lane 6 signs from WB. After finishing all the jobs, myself and XXXX picked up the signs from turnback A and started walking back to ROP. On the way back I saw few lids were off from the troffins next to turnback A and decided to put them back on for everyone's safety. XXXXXXX and I made them safe. As XXXXX(ODM) as Lookout and XXX (COSS) witness this as they were walking behind us. Then I picked up the sign and started walking again and few metres away, my left foot went through another troffin which looked visibly fine to walk over while carrying the sign which was little heavy. When I fell down and my left knee landed on the ballast. On that moment it was sore and I had bleeding. We walked back and cleared the work site. We returned to Plumstead and after finishing my shift when I went home and took my PPE off then I saw my PPE was covered with blood and by then it was painful. I bandaged it, took few pain killers, and went to sleep. When I woke up my knee was stiff and painful as it is internal injury. So, I will be resting my knee. Can you please put this in the accident book for me and forward me the copy as well. I have informed my seniors as well. Thanks."

The works involved cutting concrete in preparation for the welding points and re-rail activities scheduled during upcoming blockade. Despite adequate PPE being worn (face masks), the task could not proceed as there were additional concerns that the fumes emanated by the cutting machines would not only cause harm, but could have also triggered the fire alarms. The ODM has checked the ventilation planned and identified that there was no ventilation in the area - this situation requires escalation as the task is not safe to resume without appropriate control measures in place."
