The injured person (IP) was walking on a troughing route through the tunnel when their ankle gave way while walking on uneven lids. The IP felt some discomfort at first but carried on working. It was not until the next day that the extent of the injury was fully known, the ankle had swollen up resulting in the IP heavily strapping the ankle. The IP attended work as normal. NR2072p: The IP accessed the track by Tapnage Tunnel and then continued to walk track side in the direction of Tapnage Sub Station.  Whilst walking track side, IP stumbled slightly on a wobbly troughing route lid, his ankle gave way.   At the time IP was unaware that he had sprained his ankle and only when he return back home his ankle started to ache.  IP was wearing the appropriate PPE including correctly fitting boots that were correctly laced.   All tools and equipment were being carried in maintenance bags and IP felt that he was not overloaded by carrying excessive tools for the work required. IP was unaware that he had damaged his ankle and carried on walking to site with no further incidents.  The IP walks track side every day and is aware of the hazards and the importance of concentrating whilst walking. Due to the overgrown vegetation and ballast banks, the staff find it safer and more comfortable to walk on the flat surface of the troughing route lids. Older troughing routes tend to be worn and can become wobbly. Staff are aware of this situation and try to step in the centre of each lid to reduce the likely hood of a wobble.  The incident was then reported on his return to work the following morning where IP had strapped his ankle to support it but felt that he was okay to go back track side. Immediate cause: Staff walking track side using troughing route as the safest, flattest most even surface to access locations track side in the Tapnage Tunnel area.  Underlying cause: IP placed his foot onto the lid of one of the troughing route lids, it slightly wobbled causing IP's ankle to slightly give way creating an ankle twist.

The IP sustained bruising and a slight abrasion to their right upper arm. First aid treatment was administered on site. The IP attended their local hospital as a precaution and was released after no serious injury was found. The IP returned to work the following day. Immediate cause - Operative slipped and fell onto rocky ballast. Underlying causes -  • The amount of vegetation and poor underfoot conditions caused the cable to become snagged during the cable pull which in turn may have loosed the cable sock. • When the cable was nearing the 450 meter mark the cable sock worked its way loose and became detached from the nose of the HV cable. This in turn caused the rope to unexpectedly  to become slack and the IP to lose his footing. • In theory, the more force applied to the cable sock, the tighter it becomes (like a Chinese finger trap).  If the snagging resulted in a release of force then the cable would become slack, which should have been spotted by the IP, but was not noticed at the time of the accident.

The site extended from 106m 1562 yds to 107m 1655 yds and was called Daviot A, the squad had been working in the area for the previous 3 weeks.  On Thursday the 21st of July, the squad had being bridging the gap where two straight runs of fencing kinked to cross an area that appears to be a former siding into a disused quarry, on completion of the works at 107m 78 yds, The IP started carrying out old fencing materials and posts to the lay down area by the over line bridge at the start point - 106 m 1562 yds, when after negotiating uneven then wet and boggy ground, he tripped and landed on his left arm at 106 m 1700 yds in an area of what was dry grass and moss on hard ground. It was not obviously apparent what caused the fall.  Upon hearing IP's cry for help twp colleagues came to his aid and given the circumstances, location and apparent pain called the emergency services, this occurred at approximately 16:00hrs. The emergency services where called to the Old Station platform at Daviot where the IP was able to walk to unaided and from there area was transferred to Raigmore Hospital, Inverness.  On arrival and treatment at hospital an X-ray confirmed him to have a fracture to his left arm and was later discharged  to travel home to Perth with a referral to Perth the following day for further treatment and assessment.  Immediate cause:-  A lack of care and attention while walking along a grassy section led to a slip trip. The carrying of a 5 kilo post on his shoulder would have raised his center of gravity increasing the likliehood of a slip/trip. The additional weight of the post on his shoulder would have increased force in the fall . Underlying causes:- 1/ A 300m section of a line side fencing renewal site had restricted access due to terrain limitations (old quarry site). At the site scoping it was decided for this limited section, the redundant materials would be carried out by hand. There were a total of 60 posts each weighing approximately 5 kilo's. This equated to 20 posts per man (3 man team). The mean carry distance would be 150m. Remedial actions:- Raise awareness of poor ground conditions and risks of slips, trips and falls, especially when carrying materials which could affect normal balance and increase the fall force. Principal method of raising this awareness with be through the creation and distribution of a incident toolbox talk. Plan worksite access to minimise manual handling.

In particular, the guidance around not walking on sleepers where practical. - Underlying cause: Individual felt pressured by a number of phone calls and by personal desire not to overrun because of the effect on our customers. This pressure led to the individual rushing and a resultant lack of concentration. Evidence from speaking to the individual. Number of phone calls he was dealing with was likely to be increased due to being both the shift supervisor and the PICOP. This meant he was in contact with both Route Control, the signalbox and the rest of his team. - Underlying cause classification: Personal. - Remedial actions: See action below to assist with the individual dealing with pressure. Individual should consider delegating some activities, although not always possible, to allow better concentration. Route control should ensure they are aware of the pressure being put on individuals and support where possible. Comms to  be requested to evaluate any pressures and share any learning's.

Initially he was thought to have sprained his left ankle. The IP drove home following shift but during the afternoon and early evening the swelling increased and available movement decreased.

Investigation report -  At around 11:00am the IP had completed her shift and had changed into her trainers to drive home, had signed out at the security office and before leaving, stepped into the HOOB logistics main toilet block for a comfort break. As she entered, she placed her left foot over the door threshold and her left foot slipped to the right. This caused her to momentarily lose her balance, resulting in her foot to move suddenly and when her sole had crossed the threshold, it gripped the textured vinyl and stopped the sideways movements. This sudden stop in movement meant she fell forwards into the open door, she didn’t fall over and just steadied and righted herself, she felt pain in her left foot similar to a cramp and assumed it was a minor strain or twisted ankle. She shook her left foot as she was experiencing some pins and needles and continued about her business. She got into her vehicle and drove home, during the journey she didn’t notice or remember any significant pain. When arriving home, and exiting the vehicle she felt pain when she placed her full weight on her left foot. The foot was elevated and treated with a cold compress but this was not helping with the pain or the swelling.

It was apparent that the lid was not securely fixed into place to prevent it from moving forward when stepped upon. The incident was then reported to site management and further escalated to Amey as PC. Conclusion Site photographs and reports indicated that the hazard presented by the catch pit was not identified due to the presence of ballast, which covered the cess area, concealing the catch pit lid on site. As there was no secure fixing of the catch pit lids to prevent forward movement, any standing on the catch pit lids presented a significant risk of a trip/fall accident.

These had previously been placed to give a firmer and more level surface for access and egress purposes. He picked up the container using it's handle, gripped in his right hand. He carried it distance of circa 7m.  As the IP was walking over the aluminum track panels towards the pallet he caught his foot on one of the connection clips between two track panels, this caused the IP to stumble forward but not fall. The IP proceeded to place the water drum on a pallet and as he stood back up he felt a sharp pain in the middle of his lower back. The purpose of carrying the water was to load a pallet of materials for mixing mortar. The reason the material was being carried was to take the smaller component parts for the mortar mix to the pallet where then it could be lifted by the telehandler. This item of plant was hired and on site for the purposes of moving safely materials reducing the requirement for manual handling. Immediately after feeling the pain, the IP was taken to hospital for a checkup. Following being examined the diagnosis was a muscular sprain/strain and the IP was prescribed pain killers and advised not to carryout any lifting activity. The IP returned to work and resumed duties as a COSS. Golden Hour was initiated to track the progress of the IP. No further concerns were raised.     Immediate cause: The action of picking up of the water drum, or IP catching their foot on the panel clip whilst carrying the water drum, or the action of placing the water drum down could have caused the muscle strain to the IP's back. Underlying cause: Injury sustained first thing in the morning so the IP's muscles may not have warmed up enough and may be more prone to strain injury. IP had assessed the the weight of container (circa 10kg) that was half filled with water and was comfortable with a manual lift and carry. Panel clip caused IP to catch their foot and trip. Possibly due to trip caused a shock into the back or an incorrect technique when placing down the water drum.  Remedial actions: Site operatives verbally reminded on the correct manual handling procedure, first consideration must always be to use aids for lifting & transporting. To be followed by written briefing and to be signed by operatives.

On the bank he slipped on a landslip board and fell awkwardly onto his left wrist injuring the wrist and thumb.  Location: Stoneleigh. Injury: Left wrist and thumb swelling. NR2072P: On the 16th of October at 10:45, a Wessex Inner Off-Track Inspector, based at Clapham, was working from Stoneleigh station as an IWA (Individual Working Alone). His work was off track boundary inspections, between Worcester Park and Ewell West, on the up side of the line, whilst his colleague, an Off Track Inspector based at Feltham, was inspecting the down side of the line. The weather conditions were fair to good, it was dry underfoot and warm for the time of year. The Injured Person (IP) was approximately 9ch (200 yards) toward country of Stoneleigh station, within the 4 foot, at the time of the accident. As a train approached the Off Track Inspector, he stepped from the 4 foot into the up cess. The cess was constructed of ballast, supported by retaining boards (which reduce land/ballast slip) and as the Track Inspector stepped into the cess and on top of the ballast, it caused one of the retaining boards to spring out, resulting in him falling onto the ballast, on his left hand side and pushing back his wrist and thumb. The Off Track Inspector suffered immediate swelling to his thumb and wrist, as well as quite a lot of pain.  Following the accident, the Off Track Inspector took photographs of the site and the state of the retaining walls in this location. The accident was reported to the Inspector's line manager and initial Golden Hour Procedures were followed, although the Wessex Integrated Control Centre could not be initially reached, despite the Inspector trying on 3 separate occasions to call. On returning to his home depot, the Inspector spoke to the Inner Safety Advisor based at Clapham and the accident and the causes was discussed. Despite the initial pain and swelling, the inspector was able to continue working and returned for his next rostered turn.  Immediate cause: The ballast retaining boards within the cess gave way under the Inspector, causing him to fall onto the ballast. Underlying cause: The ballast retaining boards were struggling to keep the ballast contained within and when the Inspector stood on the ballast, this caused the retaining board to spring out. Remedial actions: The fault with the retaining walls is to be reported to Earth works for action. The accident was reported to Control and duty of care was carried out with the individual.

Taunton P-Way Depot. Lost time.","A Bristol DU D&P MOS fell whilst using a ladder in Taunton P-Way Depot and landed heavily on his back, suffering bruising. The MOS had been up a telescopic ladder leant against a cabin but one of the ladder rungs collapsed down to the next rung, causing the ladder to fall through the open door of the container.  The IP fell roughly 2 metres to the ground, hurting his left elbow and back.  The IP did not want to go to hospital but was persuaded to by his Line Manager, and when checked out he had bruising & grazes to his lower back and elbow.  IP returned to work on Monday 29th October. Immediate cause - The telescopic ladder was not properly extended and locked in position, and after weight was applied this caused the ladder to collapse down by one rung causing the ladder to fall.  The ladder was not extended beyond the platform by 1m (at least x3 rungs) so when the ladder collapsed it fell into the open doorway of the stores container.  Underlying cause - The ladder was not fitted with any maintenance tag, or stencilled expiry date and as a result, could not have been checked by the user, although electronic records show that this particular ladder was due an inspection before 04/10/2018. The ladder was not extended beyond the fixing point (platform) by the required 1m (at least x3 rungs). On checking after the accident the ladder seemed stiff to lock and one rung would not open (ladder quarantined). Remedial actions - All telescopic ladders quarantined until a full investigation has been completed. Safety alerts from Route & Bristol DU distributed for onward briefing. Briefings held with staff, confirming checks are made to all ladders ensuring they are fit for purpose prior to use.

SCO39742,"At 10:45 hours the Tamper Driver of 6U48? was changing ends within Diss Head Shunt and twisted their ankle due poor under foot condition. Tripped on vegetation and poor ballast conditions. Detail as per NR2072P Driver A was rostered to drive 6U43 10:49 Diss Sidings to Crewe PAD (Consist DR73117/DR77907 Network Rail Tamper and Regulator coupled) to Leicester where a footplate swap would take place and a different driver would take forward to Crewe PAD.  Driver A booked on duty at 05:05 hours and with Driver B, drove from Birmingham to Diss sidings.  Driver B assisted with the preparation of the train at Diss sidings then left site as planned to drive (van) to Leicester.  Driver A departed the siding Diss sidings as planned, stopped on the head shunt at Diss as planned to change ends to depart the sidings onto the mainline  The normal walking route to change ends on the siding is on the cess side of the machine in the up direction.  This is between the machine and the boundary fence.  If the walking route on the 6ft side of the machine (in the up direction) would have the individual walking adjacent to the up main on the route to Norwich (ELR LTN, line speed 100mph).   Driver A pulled into the head shunt clear of the signal when instructed to do so.  Whilst changing ends, Driver A reported slipping on loose ballast and as his right foot twisted his body twisted another way. Driver A managed to stop falling by leaning into the side of the machine. Driver A then proceeded to the other end of the machine when the initial pain rescinded by supporting his bodyweight on the side of the machine.  .Once he got into the cab, Driver A contacted SCO 24|7 to report the accident. Driver A confirmed he was fit to continue and the transit departed. Driver A was wearing compliant PPE including safety boots. Once he was relieved at Leicester, he made his way home, booking off duty at 1705hrs.  After removing his safety boots, Driver A found he was unable to put any weight on his ankle and he attended the local A&E.  After assessment, he was advised by the A&E for rest due to damage to right ankle ligaments (strain). Anglia Route Control kept updated on events (CCIL Ref 1847080). SCO RLM advised of incident. Post incident, SCO RLM followed up on following Route conference call. Photos of site provided. SCO RLM following up with Route IME.

Injury: Strain/sprain right ankle. First aid: No. Attended hospital: Yes. Lost time: 3 days as per NR2072P. Returned to normal duties 29/10/2018. IMMEDIATE CAUSES / UNDERLYING CAUSES / REMEDIAL ACTIONS - Immediate cause: Uneven walking route. - Underlying cause: Due to the geographical layout and operating restrictions, staff changing ends to depart Diss Sidings after coming out of the head shunt can either walk alongside the machine on the cess side, walk alongside the machine against an adjacent line open to traffic or take a line block. - Underlying cause classification: Practices and processes. - Remedial actions: With the safest walking route being alongside the cess side of the vehicle, this will continue.  However, this walking route must be kept clear to enable staff to walk safely.  Consideration to be made to apply a more robust surface rather than ballast and trip hazards (including vegetation). Action on SCO colleague to close out with Route Business team. BEHAVIOURAL CAUSE AND ACTIONS - Please describe the unsafe act: Walking route poor resulting in slip / trip / falls. - Was the action deliberate? No. - Please explain: Safest walking route to change ends when preparing to depart Diss sidings onto mainline.  The slip / trip / fall was not deliberate. - Informed about procedures?

Lost time","Whilst lifting a part roll of rabbit netting weighting 15kg from a van a QTS MOS twisted his left knee. The IP had positioned his hands at either end of the roll to lift it, whilst in the process of lifting he started to lose his grip (the IP was not wearing gloves at the time) so he tried to reposition his hands. As he did this he felt his right knee give way twisting inwards, resulting in him falling to the ground but not landing on the injured knee.  When his colleague noticed that the IP had fallen to the ground and was having difficulty getting up, he immediately stopped his work and went over to help the IP up and sit him on the bed of the post knocker. The IP was in a lot of pain and it was immediately realised that he needed to go to hospital. The IP's team mate got his vehicle to the site of work and applied a support bandage to the IP's right leg. He then took him to the A&E Department at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro. On arrival at the hospital the IP was admitted in to the A&E Department, his leg was x-rayed and it was confirmed that he had sustained a ligament injury to the right knee joint. The IP's knee was placed in a leg brace to immobilise it and he was then discharged home with crutches. Immediate cause - Whilst lifting a part roll of rabbit netting (approximately 15kg) off the rear of the materials trailer for transfer to the post knocker bed, the IP momentarily lost grip of the netting roll and whilst adjusting his grip he felt his right knee give way and he fell to the ground.  Underlying cause - The IP was not wearing gloves to handle/carry the rabbit netting. When the IP lifted the netting it slipped in his hands resulting in him immediately adjusting his grip so as not to drop it. This immediate adjustment of grip resulted in the motion having a negative impact on the IP's lower limbs by twisting slightly at the knee. The IP did not suitably assess the correct method for lifting the roll of rabbit netting to minimise risk of injury. Poor manual handling techniques were used when lifting the roll of netting, the IP's grip was compromised by having his arms and hands at a broad stretch (approx 1 metre apart) holding either end of the roll. This is also possibly seen as complacency on the IP's part. Remedial actions - The IP should have been wearing the appropriate PPE (gloves) when lifting the roll of netting to ensure that there was sufficient grip to handle the netting safely. The IP will be re-briefed on the importance of wearing the correct PPE and types of PPE to be worn to undertake specific tasks. The IP is to undertake manual handling refresher training to ensure that they utilise the most appropriate methods for assessing and lifting materials to prevent personal injury and injury to others. This should include taking 5 minutes to assess material handling requirements on site, utilising the hierarchy of control i.e. would it be safer to ask his team mate to stop work and help him lift the load (team lift which would have been more stable) to minimise the risk of injury. Was the action deliberate: No. Due to the minimal weight of the part roll of the rabbit netting the IP did not foresee the risk of injury from the method of lifting that he utilised. Possible complacency on his part.  Informed about procedures: Yes. The IP had all the required paperwork for the activity being undertaken i.e. task brief, work package plan and risk assessments.  Procedures clear and workable: Yes. All relevant paperwork was available at the point of work and had been read / briefed. Outcome: Slip/lapse.

They sought medical treatment subsequent to the incident where tendon damage was diagnosed. No lost time was reported. Immediate cause:- The lP was releasing the rail lifter when the weight of the rail caused him to lose his balance and fall over. This was due to incorrect methodology and process not being followed. Underlying causes:- 1/ The other rail lifter had already been released and therefore, all the weight was on one tool. Had they both been released at the same time and the weight distributed evenly then the IP would not have lost his balance. 2/ The correct methodology was not followed by either operative, in that the rail lifters should be used simultaneously where the rail is over 0.75t. The first operative had already released and removed his rail lifter before the lP had released his and therefore, the weight was not distributed evenly. Remedial actions:- 1/ Task briefing to be updated to highlight that the rail lifters will be used simultaneously with one person taking the lead in communication to ensure that they work together. This will also include that if one lifter is removed before the other one, then the lifter should be put back on to the rail to use it simultaneously. This will be briefed to all operatives on site during the task brief. 2/ Re-enactment to be carried out to demonstrate the correct use.

A member of staff tripped over a protruding wood screw which failed to be removed after being unscrewed. This resulted in injury to the persons left hand (bruising). First aid was rendered on site with injured party taking a rest from the on-going works. No hospital attendance or absence from work anticipated at this time. WDM had re-briefed staff to ensure all screws were lifted once removed from the sleeper.  WD updated - Injured person went to Wishaw General and was being examined by the Doctor. Immediate cause:- An unfastened wood screw left in the chair housing caused a trip hazard resulting in a fall which caused IP to injure hand. Underlying causes:- 1/ Repetitive nature of task, lack of attention to site environment. Fatigue fully explored but not a contributory factor. 2/ Routine sleeper changing which involves unscrewing the chairs and fully removing the screws to eliminate trip hazards was not followed fully on this occasion. 3/ Op tasked with removing screws forgot to extract them fully resulting in creating a tripping hazard which the IP failed to see this hazard and fell over hurting his left hand which he used to arrest the fall. Remedial actions:- 1/ IP is very experienced in this routine task and the associated hazards on site. IP to be briefed one to one on the S.T&Fall hazards on site and associated risks.

Following the completion of a Saturday/Sunday night shift (possession) and back at the designated access point the IP was attempting to put the drainage camera back in the van with his colleague.  This involved two members of the team lifting the camera reel (cable & metal frame/mounting - the operating module had already been removed).  Site lighting was good and included portable lights, head torches and light from the vehicle.  Underfoot conditions consisted of made ground (ballast) and was uneven throughout the access point.  As preparation for undertaking the lift the IP tilted the camera back on its wheels to enable the second team member to take hold of the frame at ground level  and to then lift into the van.  As the IP tilted the frame backwards towards himself one of the wheels sank into the ballast and the camera reel fell to one side, the IP kept hold of the reel and this ‘took him with it’ and he fell to the ground. He did not realise at the time that he had been injured, completed his shift and returned to the depot as planned.  The IP did not realise that he had sustained an injury to their lower back until they woke up later on Sunday afternoon. The IP reported the injury (lower back strain) to the on-call WD DOT (Drainage) Supervisor on Sunday afternoon but the accident was not reported to NR Fault Control until the following day (12/11/18). The IP was unable to work their next shift on 12/11/18, went to their GP on 14/11/18 and was given a Fit to Work Note advising a period of two weeks rest and prescribed painkillers and anti-inflammatories.  The IP returned to work on 03/12.  This was a 21 day LTI and has been RIDDOR reportable. Immediate cause: Incorrect manual handling of equipment whilst preparing to lift which has caused the equipment to loose stability. The IP  allowed the equipment to twist and fall whilst still holding on to the frame, which has in turn twisted the IP's lower back.and arm. Underlying cause: Loose surface conditions (ballast), wet surface conditions, reel and frame not suitable for use on ballast or a railway environment due to frame width not allowing suitable stability on loose surface.  Use of old camera equipment when newer, more suitable equipment was available for the same task. Correct Manual Handling Techniques were not deployed by the IP in the first instance, as single handed grip of the frame was used whilst attempting to lift the camera reel.

EM085. SCO 40017","At 1120 the Injured Person (IP), a Derby based PWay Technician, was working as a Lookout for track inspection work at Langley Mill. He was walking on ballast, lost his footing and tripped over in the cess. He fell heavily as carrying lookout gear. The IP suffered bruising to his left wrist, hip and ribs. No first aid was administered and no lost time was anticipated. Update from Level 1 Investigation This was the IP's second shift of the week, the first being Monday 12th Nov (07:00-15:15) His role was Site Lookout for inspection carrying out a routine BVI`(LO3B) within a transient work site at Langley Mill on the TCC walking on the Down Erewash Fast cess. IP was near the end of the patrol when he slipped over and failed to maintain a firm footing and balance whilst walking. Basic first aid was given by running his wrist under cold water, and IP was asked by the First Aider to attend A&E to get checked out but he refused and insisted he would be ok. IP had all the correct PPE on at the time of the accident and this was in good condition. IP also insisted he was ok to carry on with his normal duties and returned to work on his next shift. Immediate Cause IP did not maintain a firm footing and balance whilst walking in cess of the Down Erewash Fast whilst walking to the egress gate. Underlying Causes The IP was acting as lookout in a transient work site, which involved looking ahead for any approaching trains.  The IP had a momentary lapse of concentration in maintaining attention and focus whilst walking on the cess which was by nature loose and uneven but required for infrastructure to be compliant to standards. The lookout was using best practice methods of maintaining a position of safety whilst carrying out his duties. Remedial Actions The site was visited to see if there were any obvious hazards that could cause this to happen again. Ballast and cess condition was to the standard of the track layout and line speed at this location. No further action was warranted. Staff were reminded to take a break during the inspection when they felt it was necessary.

EM 088,"At 1222 the Injured Person (IP), a member of Bedford DU track inspection staff, was walking in the Down Slow 4ft at Radwell (Oakley) whilst carrying out track inspection and holding a LOWS box, when his left foot tripped over base plate screw. The IP fell forward into the 6ft and broke his fall with his right hand that suffered cuts. First aid was administered, no further medical attention was required and no lost time was anticipated. Update from Level 1 Investigation: Immediate Cause The Injured Person , while walking with the Inspection Team being LOWS controller, tripped on a AS screw, attached to a baseplate, in which he fell forward and while putting his hand out to break his fall, cut his right hand on the track ballast. Underlying Causes Walking too close to other team members played a part in this accident. While walking with the competent Track Inspector, they became too close to each other, which the Injured Person on walking, took a side step as not to touch shoulders, which on doing this movement, caught his foot on the AS screw, making him fall on tripping. The railway has lots of objects that were not directly on the floor, so staff had to be aware of their footing when walking on the infrastructure. Because the IP did not have either firm footing, or raise his foot high enough, he caught it on the edge of the screw (which he did say was completely fastened down) which resulted in his fall. Re-brief Staff regarding the weights of the equipment that they were using, making sure they took this into account when sleeper drilling sleepers. Ask for ideas in a way of improving the current method, including having staff take over at sooner intervals if the user felt any tightness in the back. Remedial Actions The Team was briefed the day after (23/11/2018) regarding how they could have improved the site on that day. It was discussed that staff undertaking this type of moving work site, should keep a minimum of 2 metres away from each other, and if you did need to ""overtake"" a staff member while walking, make sure they take right angles and not try to move past unless they have firm feet.

The IP was walking in the 4ft when one of the boards gave way causing them to fall through up to their hip. Colleagues pulled the IP out and took him back to the van. No first aid was provided although the IP later visited a walk in medical centre.  NR2072p: Whilst undertaking an inspection of a timber walkway on Lymington Viaduct, a Bournemouth track section supervisor fell through a broken walking board up to his hip, and narrowly missed falling into the water below. Although a steel strut lying horizontally underneath the broken timber board prevented him from falling further, in doing so the supervisor's kneecap was struck quite violently, and severely injured him in the process. The supervisor needed significant assistance to extract from the jagged hole left by the broken board, and had to be supported so as to walk from the structure. As a Lost Time Injury, not only were the DU extremely fortunate to not have a more serious incident, the supervisor was unable to walk and inspect other safety critical track assets for a crucial 7 days, thus creating other safety and compliance pressures for the track section manager to mitigate.  After initial triage at a local hospital and within the golden hour management of him by the DU, the supervisor was taken home and has been convalescing so as to allow the soft tissue damage around his knee and hip to recover. Although the supervisor is still suffering pain in his left knee, he is gradually more able to walk unassisted, and is just recovering sufficiently to return to normal supervisor duties. It is not yet known if there will be longer term complications from the supervisor's injury, given the impact to the cartilage and knee joint. There will be an occupational health referral to both support him, and see that he has all the advice he needs to recover in the longer term, as lower leg and joint injuries of this nature can be hidden if not treated properly, especially for someone who relies on being able to walk to fulfil their career as a track section supervisor. This is the second serious injury to a member of Outer DU on this structure in 3 months. The RAM Structures team have had a close call raised for a repair of the timber walkway for over a year. After a review of the DU's open close calls, escalations were raised about the condition of the timber walkway and other structures of concern in the Outer area including key leaking tunnels and other walkways of concern. Unfortunately, prior to a repair being undertaken and this serious injury, a member of the Bournemouth track patrolling team was injured by a very similar timber board failure on the same structure. After this first injury, the timber structure was deemed unsafe, track patrolling was stopped and an urgent repair was requested, in line with the close call already raised. After a repair and a re-inspection by the Structures team, accompanied by the TME, the walkway was re-opened.  The second accident, of which this Level 1 report refers, occurred after the repair to the timber walkway structure. Although the IMDM has raised concerns about this, and other structures in the Outer area, there is yet to be a formal review of risk, with an update of inspections and shared understanding, between the DU and the RAM Structures team. The first formal risk review will now be in January 2018. A new RAM Structures is fully engaged, is responding quickly and there is a much more in depth and urgent risk review ongoing, that will satisfy a new IME and IMDM that any further risk is mitigated, and that our staff are not unnecessarily injured by a structure in future. Immediate cause: A weak walking board on Lymington Viaduct timber walkway. Underlying cause: The lack of rigorous checking, when effecting a repair from a previous accident on the same timber structure that  requires renewal.  Remedial action: The timber walkway remains closed to patrolling, pending the assessment of further repairs conducted by the Structures team. A planned joint inspection on Monday 17 December was cancelled by the Structures team.  DCP Comments: I take the extraordinary step of commenting in this box, to express my concern about the risk management of structures in the Outer area and, as a DCP, I require assurance that clear practices and procedures will prevent as far as reasonably practicable, a similar chain of events repeating.

It was later advised that a Technician also suffered arc eye effect. They attended a walk-in centre and were given some eye drops, Immediate cause: The Live End of a long blue earth came into contact with a live feed at Ulgham Feeder Station. Underlying cause: The configuration of this building was different to other Buildings. The live feeds that come from the Distribution Network Operators were in the middle of the building directly next to the risers which were being earthed up. In this case approx. 1 metre apart. The underfoot conditions within Ulgham Feeder Station were poor.  There were 2 raised troughing lids directly under where the earths were being applied and there was a short distance approximately 2 metres between the building and the palisade hindering free movement.  The only lighting was what would be taken to site. Remedial actions: Unless there was a product approved physically insulated barrier that can be applied between the live feeds and the risers when applying the same working methods for this isolation of the Overhead Line Engineer (OLE) then the only other alternative was to operate the 2 double pole disconnectors at the back of the building prior to the OLE Staff applying their earths to the risers or an alternative method where the live feeds were made dead. Look into additional lighting to illuminate inside the compound but in particular to illuminate between the fence and the building where the earths get applied.

(SCO 40683),"At 12:30 a lower back injury had occurred whilst working on NRT TPI DCMS Fibre Network JTT works (Manchester to York), at Gelderd Road access, Leeds. A team of eight were tasked to lift and tuck 432 fibre cable within the trough route (lifting troughing lids to allow cable to be tucked into the trough). The team were also tasked with securing the trough lids by installing clips and straps. Shift duration was from 08:30 until 16:30. For the first part of the shift, the Contractor was tasked with carrying trough lid securing clips to pass to other workers as they resecured trough lids. At 12:30 the Contractor began lifting lids, which consisted of flipping lids off the trough so that they  lay on the ballast next to the trough. Full lid removal was necessary to be able to fit the securing clips inside each trough. When flipping a lid, the Contractor reported having twinged their lower back. The injured party (IP) reported the issue to the PIC and was instructed not to carry out any more work and proceeded to sit in the work van from 12:40 until the end of the shift.  The IP claimed the incident occurred whilst handling their first lid.  The IP arranged a medical appointment for the next day. 7+ days lost time. Immediate cause: the Contractor manually handling a troughing lid. The team had mechanical aids available (slab lifters); however, this device was not suitable for the C17 lids being lifted on this occasion. Jafco and other lid lifters have been used/tried on other projects and are often found unsuitable for a number of reasons (they are for tilting lids only, they are not easy to use where lids are part buried or where there is ballast covering or where lids are cracked or damaged, lids are often glued and lifters are not time efficient). Underlying cause: personal: work related attitude - propensity for taking risk and physical wellbeing - ill health. The IP had an ongoing back injury that they had not disclosed at any point prior to the incident, including when completing their health surveillance questionnaire and declaration. The task brief also instructed that workers were to bring any injuries or illnesses to the attention of their PIC and line manager; the IP didn't do so to the PIC controlling the work at the time of the injury. The team was being led by a different leader to their regular PIC. The team's regular PIC (a family relation to the IP) was aware of the back injury and its tendency to flare up, but had also not declared the vulnerability to HR or line management. When completing the accident report for this incident, the IP declared that they had an ongoing back problem from a car accident approximately two years previously.  The IP was conducting manual labour with a vulnerability, which, if reported, would have been foreseeable as a possible cause of a back injury. The teams risk assessment and task brief instructed to use lifting aids where possible. The team continued to lift lids by hand. Manually lifting lids by hand is a normal practice, but in this case, added to the IP's vulnerability and became causal in the accident.  Knowledge, skills and experience: training, comprehensive. The tasks risk assessment and task brief instruct that large/heavy items are to be lifted by two persons. When lids are being lifted using the method employed on this task, the workers do not consider the lids to be a heavy item. Task risk assessments should stipulate which objects require lift teams, but instead have left the choice to the worker.  When the investigation reviewed residual risk controls in the projects design risk assessment, it was evident that the engineer developing task plans had not consulted the design risk assessment to transfer the designers risk controls. This is a non-conformance in not applying instructions provided with the company's management system (WIN210 'Safe Work Planning'). Remedial actions: the IP and PIC are to be interviewed further by line management with HR and disciplinary action taken as necessary. Operational leaders training and tests for delivery engineers are to be updated to expand on the existing content provided for risk assessments for delivery engineers.",,Unknown,,"Linbrooke Services Ltd, Network Rail",Infrastructure worker,Duties to maintain track or infrastructure,Error or violation,Failing to stabilise body during travel,0.01,Workforce (on-duty): Severe 7

Upon arriving at site, the IP acting as COSS and  PIC mentally noted that the four foot area of the tunnel was flooded, had irregular underfoot conditions due to calcification of the ballast and sleepers, in addition to slurried limestone deposits. The IP recorded this as 'Uneven surfaces - various materials in 4ft / Cess' on the additional site specific hazards portion of their RT9909 form. Staff at site utilised Samelite headlamps for walking and hand torches for inspection purposes. Due to the underfoot conditions, the IP decided to walk on the grated drainage system located in the 6 foot.  The IP was not conducting the Ultrasonic inspection but they were attempting to identify 'Tunnel Plaque numbers' which were located on the tunnel wall. Whilst attempting to locate the tunnel plaque numbers and continuing to walk along the drainage system, the IP came into contact with a raised grating lid, tripped and whilst attempting to break their fall cut their hand and knee on the drainage system / track furniture.  IP was given emergency first aid at site and later taken to Tameside A&E where they received four stitches to the hand laceration.  They were off work for over 7 days.

No lost time confirmed. Immediate cause: A slip on ice that had formed in the car park after opening of the depot. Underlying cause: Insufficient surface drainage to the newly re-laid car park and (unusually) a falling temperature as the morning progressed.   There is an existing process in place at the depot to grit the surface of the car park in icy weather. The first person to arrive in the morning is expected to do this if they are able to do so.  On this occasion, the records of a weather station in the general area did record a falling temperature during the morning from +0 degrees Celsius to -0 degrees during the course of the morning. During the general arrival time at the depot (circa 0630 to 0800) the temperature was + 0, it fell below zero later in the morning. The CCTV record was checked and concurs with the individual's version of events. Remedial actions: The contractor (Serfis Construction) that had just re-laid the surface was called back after the incident and they accepted that the new tarmac had not been laid to the correct fall and / or had adequate drainage.

EM004.,"At 1100 the Injured Person (IP), a member of Derby DU PWay staff, was walking from Forbes Hole (Long Eaton Town area) during a site visit/inspection and twisted his ankle. It was initially believed to be a minor injury but he discovered swelling on arrival at home when his boot was taken off. The IP attended Doncaster Royal Infirmary and a sprained ankle was diagnosed. The IP would take suitable rest at home prior to his next booked shift. He confirmed he would be at work for next booked shift on the following Saturday night. Update from Level 1 Investigation: The IP was in the process of taking off some clamp plates on a scrap piece of rail at Trent East Forbes hole - TSN1 - 119.1600 -(working off track) when the IP stood on a piece of ballast which resulted in turning his ankle. The IP didn't report the injury to his manager who was on site with him until approximately 45 minutes later when he asked him why he was limping, the IP explained he had turned his ankle on a piece of ballast when he was working at Trent East, Forbes hole. He asked him if he was ok and IP said it was just a slight strain, and he would be ok to continue walking on the ankle. His manager then pointed out if he thought he had caused damage to the ankle he would have to report it through to control. When he had finished the job his manager told him to go back to Mercia House to rest and to take the weight of the ankle. At the end of his shift he drove home back to Doncaster.  Once he was home he removed his boot and the ankle appeared swollen and bruised. The IP then went to Doncaster Royal Infirmary for a X-Ray which proved the damage was a bad sprain and he was advised to rest it.  He followed the doctor's advice and then turned in for his next rostered shift on the Saturday night. Immediate Cause The IP stood on a piece of ballast resulting in him turning his ankle. Underlying Causes The IP whilst carrying out his duties didn't see a stone which resulted in him standing on it and turning his ankle. Remedial Actions The IP should have reported the injury to is manager straight away, who was on site at the time, so first aid could have been given and ice packs could have been put on the damaged ankle to prevent swelling. A brief would be given to the IP and all other staff regarding the process about reporting any future accidents and incidents.

Immediate cause - The IP turned and tripped over the string-line. He did not see this and it caused the IP to stumble, and injure the ankle. Underlying cause - The IP went to get a tool to help another person with an activity and, in the process, tripped over the string-line. Either he did not notice this despite being alerted to it’s location beforehand, leading to an underlying cause of lack of care and attention by the individual injured, or he was not alerted by the person using the string-line, in which case the underlying cause could be attributed to staff on site not considering the welfare of others working in the same area.

However, the abutment was constructed at a skew to the superstructure, his foot slipped off the abutment shelf and went down 1ft into the void created by the removed panel. The distance of the fall was not large enough for his fall arrest equipment to deploy. The operative steadied himself by holding out his left arm to grab onto the rail and waybeam. This action, caused his left shoulder to dislocate upon connecting with the rail. The operate got up on his own accord and initially indicated that he was fine. The accident occurred at the end of the works, so all operatives were finishing up at the time. On completion of the shift, the operative asked to attend A&E. After attending Dr Gray's hospital in Elgin, they confirmed it was dislocated, and popped it back in before sending the operative home.  No Lost time was incurred. Immediate cause:- The Immediate cause of the accident was the removal of the Walkway Panel. Underlying caused:- Incorrect placement of lighting caused shadows withing the 4-foot work area; combined with falling rain and cold temperatures, contributed to the operative mis-judging the angle of the abutment, leading to his foot slipping into the void. Remedial action:- As this was the last panel to be re-positioned, all the works required for this shift were completed. Upon reinstatement of these walkways at the end of the works, additional lighting will be provided for the 4-foot / or lit from underneath the bridge, which will ensure all walking routes and working areas are clearly visible.",Level,Brick,,"Network Rail, T.

Member of staff tripped over a small rail length which was lying on the ground, stumbled and prevented falling by extending arm, jarring left wrist in the process. IP attended Glasgow Royal Infirmary.  IP had proceeded to walk to the main office and collect his working instructions and paperwork for that nights task. IP walked directly in a straight line and then he moved  in between parked vehicles. He then stepped onto the concrete island which is used  to segregate vehicles, which in turn prevents any collision by having two raised pavement stones (Kerbs) separated by a small concreted island covered on top by an array of small black stones. During maneuvering over the concrete island, the IP suddenly tripped over a length of scrap rail about 3ft in length that had been unceremoniously left in the middle of the concrete island. The shadows of the already parked vehicles combined with the dark colour of the rail situated in an already unlit area would have made the rail almost indistinguishable from the surroundings. As the IP was falling he extended his left hand to break his fall. The IP stated that he got up immediately from his fall and felt only a ""little pain in his left hand/wrist"". The IP  then informed his welding manager of the accident at approximately 22:36. The IP and Manager then went to investigate the area where he had fallen. Manager then proceeded to take pictures and moved the short length of rail under the overhang of a parked pick up vehicle. This was to prevent any chance of a re-occurrence, the rail was eventually removed and placed in the scrap metal skip within the delivery units designated waste area. The decision was made for IP to attend the Royal Infirmary Hospital and have his hand checked over by trained medical staff. Provision was made for the IP  to be taken to the hospital by the Team leader welder whom was then instructed to drive the IP to Glasgow Royal Infirmary and whom  was dropped off at exactly 23:15. In the hospital the IP's hand was assessed and he was also sent for X-Ray. Early diagnosis of his injuries was that it was a suspected broken Lunate bone in his left hand. The IP was given no medication at the hospital and told only to self medicate with paracetamol at home.  Workforce Health,Safety and Environmental Advisor phoned IP on Wednesday 30/01/19 to find out how he was and if he could come to his home address to gather more information surrounding his accident. The IP  duly agreed and WFHSEA visited the IP's home address at 09:30 on the 01/02/2019. The IP then advised that he received a from call from someone at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 31/01/2019 at about 16:00 to say they had looked over he X-Rays again and insisted the original diagnosis of a broken Lunate bone in his left hand might be wrong and its most probably a bad sprain.  IP did convey to the WFHSEA that the pain was still sore and was making arrangements for an appointment with his own General Practitioner for a second opinion . WFHSEA confirmed the IP attended his GP and confirmed as a bad sprain with a further 2 weeks sick line from 25/02/19. Immediate causes:- Tripping over Scrap rail, which had been left on the raised island used as segregation for parked vehicles .  Underlying causes:- 1/ Management and Storage of redundant materials to specific waste areas. Staff using vehicle separation area as  unofficial walking route. 2/ Staff unaware of official walking routes at rear car park to and from main office. 3/ Poor-House  and hazard identification of redundant materials in unauthorized and dangers areas. 4/ CCTV coverage and lighting of this area was not well covered. Failure to identify persons responsible for leaving scrap rail in a dangerous position.  Remedial actions:- 1/  1) Alert E-mail sent out to all Mangers in the Glasgow DU to warn staff of accident and ensure all redundant material are placed in the appropriate waste areas.       2) Safety Slide of actual area made to identify the effects of poorhouse keeping.       3) Brief  All staff of dangers and prohibition of walking on concrete island.       4) Sign-age erected to prohibit walking on vehicle segregated island. 2/ Overhead schematic/photo with demarcated walking route highlighted and given to all line managers to share with staff. 3/ Daily checks made of car park and stores area of depot to identify poor house keeping or storage.

The IP (Injured Person), a contractor from Volker Rail, went to hospital with a colleague. Update from investigation: Site were in the process of setting up shutters and prepping ready for a concrete pour the next week, using small light weight frame shutters circa 450mm high. All shutters were connected and tied down. There was an inner shutter around a 2.5 x 2.5 proposed base and then an outer burrow beam shutter typically 300mm wide. In order to get to the centre of the works, operatives had to step over the burrow beam shutter (300mm wide plus shutters say 500mm wide) into the gap between the slab shutter and the beam shutter. The gap was typically 600mm wide. All ground was compacted type 1 and the centre of the slab pour was blinded with concrete. Conditions at the time were dry and clear. The IP was setting out and checking the levels for shutters. He was moving his equipment carrying tripod legs and survey box so had both hands full. He stepped over the first shutter into the space and then preceded to step into the temporary generator base over the second shutter still carrying equipment. As soon as he had stepped over and lifted his following leg he had 'twisted' on his leading planted foot and toppled over. His foot had then swollen up. Operatives around aided the IP and the incident was reported through to VRCC at 14:30hrs. Airsweb report was: 57605 The equipment being carried could have been passed to the engineer so that stepping over the shutter free of carrying materials, and an assessment whether the equipment  needed to be carried in the shuttered area was not carried out. The task could possibly have  been done from outside of the area. There was potential for the pan shutter to have been left out, but shutters were integrated and at some stage needed to be connected. They were only low shutters at 450mm high and max 500mm wide so it was deemed adequate to step across in one movement. Ground conditions were level and compacted.  The operatives drove the IP to A&E hospital in Milton Keynes near to his house and he was taken in to see the doctor. He had subsequently had an initial x ray on his ankle and foot and they determined that the ankle was fine. He had then been sent for a second X ray which had been inconclusive. The IP had been booked to see a specialist on Thursday the next week as that was the first appointment. He was given crutches to prevent putting weight on foot. The IP returned to work following the planned consultation with a consultant on 21.02.19 Immediate Cause Loss of concentration, carrying too much equipment (manual handling) while stepping over the shutter. Trip hazard with the shutter but operative had stepped over. Underlying Cause Operative carrying out his normal duties carrying equipment to set out and check works. Combination of carrying equipment and stepping over the shutter lost footing.   Remedial Actions IP to be interviewed, interview to include an assessment of task risk, for example, the equipment could of been passed to the engineer so that stepping over the shutter free of carrying materials.

Works Delivery Contractor fell from height at Abergavenny,"Whilst inspecting the scaffolding around a bridge at Abergavenny station, a Mikerry Rail Ltd employee (under contract to Centregreat Rail) fell from an unknown height onto the level below. He was taken to hospital by ambulance, the extent of the injuries were unknown. Later reported work was in connection with footbridge refurbishment for Works Delivery. The fall was approximately 1.1 metres and the person sustained bruising to his back and was released from hospital without any prescribed medication. The person returned to work on 18/02/19. Further information: On returning to work his back was still sore and his movement was stiff. There was no bruising that had shown as yet. He confirmed that he had been prescribed medication on discharge from hospital. The medication was making him drowsy and management were not prepared to let him drive or work in this condition and advised him to rest at home with his family. Transport to his home was provided. Level 1 report: Whilst conducting site supervisor perimeter checks and ensuring site was secure for the weekend, the person was taking photos towards the top trestle/ span area on the third lift in the encapsulated scaffold area on Platform 1. As he leant against the scaffolding handrail, the top handrail failed and the person fell 1.1 metres to the second lift. The person called the emergency services and was taken to Neville Hall Hospital, Abergavenny. After assessment and X-Rays, he was discharged at approx. 4pm on the same day with prescribed medication for pain relief. He attended work on Monday 18th February, but was stiff in movement and drowsy from the effects of the medication and so was sent home to recover. He attended his GP on Wednesday 20th February as the pain was not easing and he was prescribed stronger pain killers. He privately attended a back specialist Physiotherapist on Thursday 21st February where they suspected a trapped nerve but were not prepared to administer treatment until the inflammation had gone down. He went back into Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, to have his condition double checked on Friday 22nd February. A secondary X-Ray was taken and compared to the one from 15th February and his old injury. It was identified at this point that there was a fracture on the bone below the old injury and this variance was missed on the assessment on 15th February. He was booked in for an MRI scan for Friday 1st March for the consultant to rule out any complications. Following the MRI scan, the consultant has confirmed the injury was a bulging disc of L5 S1 and there was no fracture. Due to the non complex injury, the IP was advised to rest for up to 6 to 8 weeks. Immediate cause: The mechanical failure of the double right hand couplers (drop forged class B) has been ruled out. Both couplers on the same top hand rail were not defective, but ineffective. Once quarantined from site, their mechanical performance (thread/ nut/ washer arrangement and operation) and integrity (non cracks or unusual wear) proved sufficient and aligned to their Certificate of Conformity. These were inspected by a competent scaffold supply chain. Tightness checks of other couplers confirmed the required 50kN torque was being achieved on site.  Following investigation interviews of circa 15 individuals both internally and from the supply chain of those who were onsite in the weeks leading up to the incident, the investigation did not identify any direct, deliberate interference with the scaffold. This therefore led to a belief that a sub standard act, from unknown individual/s, by failing to reinstate the loosened couplers by person/s not in a competent role to do so, guides to the main underlying cause.   The white material of the encapsulation provided suitable lighting conditions in the daytime for when the supervisor was conducting his checks. The 'less than 200 yards visibility' referred to the fact that the encapsulation did not provide any visibility further than the work area. Underlying cause: An alleged belief of human intervention of a sub standard act - this being to be able to gain access to part of the fixed stair structure from the scaffold in order to obtain better access to undertake a job, or to speed the job up. It was acknowledged that the site specific conditions had proved challenging relating to the environment, the scaffold design and the interface with project specific tasks e.g. grit blast activity, and that this may have had an influence on the alleged human intervention. Remedial actions: 1.] Initiate a stand down with staff and sub contracted staff to deliver the key messages from the incident namely:      a.) Although not proved, the alleged human intervention with a scaffold albeit well intentioned, has had a negative impact on the team - directly with a person being hurt (the person being well known to the majority of the team would probably create an uncomfortable feeling and discussions and sharing of this incident throughout the employees and sub contractors would go towards the learning and importance that unsafe acts could hurt others). During this session open the discussions with the team to understand any reasons why staff did not feel they can speak up, report hazards/ unsafe acts or conditions. Ask if anyone had ever used Worksafe Procedure or reported close calls on their site. Encourage all staff and contractors to speak up if they are unsure and provide confidence that they will be supported and not isolated in doing so by the project team and leadership on CGR sites.      b.) Brief a tool box talk specifically on scaffolds and working at height and reinforce the message of reporting close calls and stopping work through Worksafe Procedure when something is unsafe.      2.] Review the Lone Working procedure to ensure to identify any scenarios where potential lone working, in particular with Site Supervisors. Ensure that the project teams were briefed any changes from the procedure and that lone working situations were identified, risk assessed, controlled and managed through the project CPP/ WPP/ TBS process. From the learning of this accident, the site supervisor did not need to be on his own and was in a fortunate position that after his fall, he was in a position to, and did have access to his mobile phone to contact the emergency services. All site supervisors to ensure they had a secondary point of contact that remained on site whilst conducting their site perimeter/ end of shift checks. 3.] Where unable to eliminate risk through design, any potential areas of a scaffold or temporary works that had the potential of human intervention, implemented a process of an intrusive survey. This would be in addition to the standard statutory weekly visual inspection and would include a recording sheet of physical checks and 10% torque checks of couplers within these areas. A dynamic review of the scaffold design during the construction phase shall be implemented on future projects ensuring the scaffold was still suitable and did not prevent good ergonomic working conditions whilst still providing safe access and egress, remaining to consider emergency arrangements. Additional actions already completed: 1. Independent scaffold checks at site of incident but also of temporary footbridge installation. Sufficient checks completed with no remedial actions. 2. Independent scaffold checks at other sites being delivered to Network Rail with the same scaffold sub contractor those being Rhiwbina Station, Cardiff Central Station and Sudbrook Pumping Station.

EM014,"The Injured Person (IP), a Derby DU Lorry Driver, called Control to report he had fallen from the back of his truck whilst loading it (approximately 2ft) and had bruised the left side of his arm. He was not expecting to be absent from work due to the injury but was advised to call 111 as this would be classed as a fall from height. His Line Manager was aware. At 1250 111 had advised the IP to attend A+E to get checked over. The IP was to attend Ilkeston A and E and was driving himself there.  Six hour update received - the IP had been released from hospital with some bruising. He was expected back at work the next day but additional driver was planned to cover duties in case he wasn't fit for duty. Update 27/02/19 - the IP returned to work the following day on normal duties. Update from Level 1 Investigation: The IP was loading rail onto his lorry at Mercia House in the area near to Chaddesden sidings.  Having completed the load he then positioned the straps so that he could secure his load. As he climbed down from the bed of the lorry down its built-in access steps, he stepped off the last rung of the ladder and his right hand boot got caught under the steps retaining clip causing him to lose his balance and fall to the ground. He then completed the task and returned back to Mercia stores and informed his line manager what had happened.  The accident was then reported to the EMCC and the IP was advised to call NHS 111 for medical advice on his injury.  The IP was reluctant to go to hospital but he did attend following the advice given by NHS 111. Having visited the Walk-In Centre at Ilkeston they diagnosed that he had some bruises and abrasions and that he was likely to feel stiff in the morning. The following day he turned up for work as normal and completed his normal driving duties. Immediate Cause The IP caught his foot on the ladder retaining catch. Underlying Causes The ladder retaining catch sticks out on the inside and above the last rung of the ladder. The hand grab to maintain 3 points of contact is too high off the ground. The step down from the last ladder rung was 450mm above level ground making it a high step Remedial Actions The catch would be removed and reported to the fleet manager.

The IP was observing the bridge being swung into position when he caught his foot in some vegetation and strained his right knee. He continued work with no first aid required at the time. As Colwall has a single platform station one leg of the footbridge was sitting on the platform while the other was situated on a level concrete base on unmaintained land. The accident occurred on the side of the bridge situated on the unmaintained  level land. The area where the operative was working was muddy due to heavy rain fall. De-vegetation work had also been recently been carried out to allow for safe access to the works area. At 02:20 hours, the IP alleged that he caught his foot on some brambles when he moved his leg forward whilst accessing the area and that in doing so his knee twisted round to the left and he felt his knee twinge. There were conflicting reports that lighting at the time was inadequate. A site witness stated that the lighting was adequate, but the area was in shadow although not in darkness. Station lighting was provided. No other additional lighting had been provided. At the time of the accident one of the lights on the station went out (presumably on a timer) leaving the area where the operative was working poorly lit. This may have been a contributing factor but statement evidence, from the Injured Person or site witnesses of this was not provided by persons to substantiate, although photographs were taken of the location by Dyer and Butler. The IP reported the incident to the Network Rail Construction Manager , who was on site at the time and the Dyer & Butler site personnel, who were on the platform, directly following the accident. The incident was reported to the Route Control Manager via the approved contact number and the accident was logged.  At approximately 13:00 hours on the 10/03/2019 the Network Rail Construction Manager contacted the IP for an update on how he was following the accident. The IP stated  that he had called NHS 111 due to the pain in his knee and that they had advised him not to go to A&E but instead visit his local GP. The IP stated that an appointment had been made for him to visit the GP at 11:45 hours on the 10/03/2019. Following the GP appointment, the IP then said that he had been issued a sick note for 7-10 days to rest his leg and, should the knee not get better, to visit the doctor again. However Dyer and Butler had only submitted a Statutory Sick Pay note, which was signed on the 12th March 2019. At the time of the Level 1 NR had not received a GP Fit Note.  Immediate cause - The IP caught their foot in brambles / vegetation, with a slight slip on the mud underneath, causing the operative to twist his knee. Underlying cause - The IP claimed there was insufficient lighting meaning they had not been able to see their footing correctly. Remedial actions - Additional lighting to site to light up the working area, behind the footbridge columns. Was the action deliberate: No. Informed about procedures: Yes. The IP reported the accident to colleagues on site, but was reluctant to complete the full accident details on site but was persuaded. Procedures clear and workable: Yes. Outcome: Slip/Lapse.

The IP was using a bar in an attempt to ease the new rail longitudinally along the cess when the IP described feeling a snap / strain behind the right calf. The IP then lost the power in their leg and fell forward into the cess, ending up on the ground approximately 3 metres away. The incident was reported to control immediately. The IP visited their doctor the following day and was diagnosed with a torn muscle above the knee and possible tendon damage. The IP was initially signed off work for 10 days. This was later extended for a further 10 days. Immediate cause:- The IP slipped on loose ballast while maneuvering a piece of rail into position manually. Underlying causes:- 1/ Wet weather / poor ground conditions. 2/ Rail was being moved using a bar to ease the rail longitudinally along the cess, as opposed to the use of rail grabs which is the preferred method for manually moving rail in TWI 2G046 that would have allowed additional manpower to be allocated to the task. 3/ Rail was mechanically delivered in a position that required manual adjustment to commence installation. Remedial actions:- 1/ Incident included in route safety cascade for discussion to raise awareness. 2/ Review of the methodology being used between the TME and the WFHSEA required to confirm if the method being used was acceptable.  Review complete 18/03/19. TWI 2G046 states that ""a rail can be moved very small distances by easing it with bars."" To use rail grabs, bullhead rail needs to be canted, then held in position using bars while staff position themselves around the rail with grabs. Review concludes that for a 6"" movement then the use of grabs would have no safety benefit and may in fact increase the risk. If mechanical means were being used to install the rail, similar manual movements with the bar would probably be required to position the rail for up lift. 3/Review of working practices - complete - the move required was minimal at 6"" and as such there is no major issue with the methodology being used to drop the rails off in position. Where dropping off materials to be manually handled at a later date, this incident highlights the need to consider carefully the position in which materials are left to minimise the need for later manual handling.

Cardiff DU E&P staff fractured an ankle at Bridgend,"A member of E&P staff rolled (twisted) his left ankle walking on ballast at Bridgend West / Llynfi Jcn. The person finished his shift and went to A&E for examination. No time loss envisaged. Injury later confirmed as a fractured ankle. Level 1 report. Whilst working at Llynfi Junction (Bridgend West) the person's role was to carry out lookout duties as part of the P&D maintenance teams points heating work. Following completion of the work, the PIC assembled the team in a position of safety to begin the  walk back to the access point. Whilst walking back to the access point the person stepped into an uneven section of ballast and twisted his ankle. Immediate cause: IP was walking on uneven ballast and stepped into a ditch within the shoulder. Following site inspection the uneven ballast was a result of a speed being implemented and then removed, to which the relevant teams did not back fill and level out the area. Underlying cause: The IP was walking at the front of the group acting as lookout, as the first person to walk in this area, no warning was given beforehand to warn him of the ditch in the ballast. The area of uneven ground left in area of ballast from speed implementation was not back filled. This caused the IP to twist his ankle within the ditch. Overgrown cess meant that the team needed to walk on ballast for access and egress. Also, large amount of redundant equipment has been left in the cess blocking the use of the larger cess area. Remedial action: Site visit carried out to inspect working area. Overgrown vegetation and uneven ballast found to be contributing factors. Issues to be raised with the relevant P-way department to ensure ballast is made even. Issues of vegetation to be raised with Off Track for clearing. Since the accident Port Talbot P.way have attended site and levelled the area. Awaiting date for vegetation removal from Off Track department. Underlying cause: Whilst the team were walking back on ballast, the IPs concentration lead him to unwittingly step into the ditch within the uneven ballast area.

The IP was working as a site lookout within a moving work site.  The team's work involved clearing ballast from the tops of 5 catch pits, so as to aid future inspections. A large amount of stone had been run out along the sleeper ends here covering the catch pits. After clearing ballast of lids of fifth and final catch pit, they were then ready to move over to the up road where the walking route was more suitable.  The IP, who was acting as lookout, stepped onto the centre of a concrete catch pit lid which gave way under his right leg. This caused the IP's left knee to come down on catch pit lid to left of him.  The Team Leader immediately took over the Lookout duties. The Team Leader believes due to large amount of ballast being run out it had pushed catch pit lid away from edge of catch pit ring underneath that supports the lid.

Whilst undertaking duties setting up access equipment, he stumbled and went over on his ankle. This was subsequently discovered at hospital as being broken. Whilst carrying out the examination of the Retaining Wall on the railway boundary the IP who was the machine operator for a MEWP T22 truck, had moved the machine to another position further along the wall. The IP and a Network Rail Structures Examiner got into the basket but for some reason the machine would not work, so the IP got out of the basket to check the support legs on the wall side of the machine. Due to having to extend the legs out they were up against the wall so to get to the control panel at the centre of the vehicle he had to bend down to get under the extended leg, which he did without issue. On his way back out while passing under the extended support leg, he stated he felt his ankle crack. He stated he could hardly put any support on the ankle. The staff on site managed to take his boot off but the ankle did not look swollen at the time but he said it was causing him pain and could hardly stand on it. He managed to slip his boot back on and make his way to a colleagues work vehicle where staff took him to Carlisle A&E to get his ankle checked. IP was wearing the correct PPE, he had boots on and they were fastened up and they had to help him take one off to inspect his foot. Immediate cause: It would seem by analysing the evidence and statements from those on site and from the IPs senior management team who have spoken to the IP that there was no singular cause, other than his ankle gave way leading to his weight being applied which led to the fracture. Underlying cause: From reviewing the site photos and visiting site there were no visible hazards underfoot other the the kerb separating the pavement to the public road. The tarmac at the site of work was level with no signs of pot holes or defective sections that could pose a tripping hazard. Safety boots were worn and fastened, though whether these were sufficiently fastened has been undetermined. Remedial action: As this seems to be a case of the IP going over on his ankle with no contributing factors from the site of work or environmental it was recommended that all staff take care where they are walking on site. Staff to be mindful of all surfaces even when they seem level and free of underfoot hazards. Staff to make sure that suitable footwear are worn and sufficiently fastened to give the foot/ankle suitable support at all times.

Incident had been investigated and was ready to be closed. Update from Accident Report; On Thursday 25th April 2019 at approx. 14:15hrs, the IP was working adjacent to the train on the ballasted area between the tarmac and running rail. As he walked along the ballast his weight shifted and he twisted his ankle. He felt a sharp pain but was able to continue working. He was not rushing, or carrying any equipment or tooling at the time. The weather conditions were fine and dry, and conditions underfoot were level. IP felt discomfort from his ankle as the shift went on, and found it hard to stand towards the end of his shift. IP declined medical attention as his wife was collecting him from work. Later that evening he visited Doncaster A&E where the ankle was X-Rayed and confirmed not broken but sprained. IP was not fit for work on Friday 26/04/19, he rang his supervisor to inform him accordingly. The event was raised on SWA at 0900hrs on Friday 26/04/19 when it was evident this was an LTA. IP returned to work on 29/04/2019. Recommendations: To prevent, or reduce the risk of further occurrence, it was agreed to recommend the use of pea shingle as a stabiliser / filler on the ballasted areas either side of the running rail for the full extent of the hard standing unloading area. This would help prevent shifting of the larger ballast pieces when walked over.

The IP had been walking in the 4ft when the trip occurred causing them to fall backwards in to the 10ft side running rail. The IP's back came in to contact with the rail and a bar they were holding at the time struck their right arm. No medical attention was required and the IP continued work. NR2072p: At approximately 02:00 on the 9th of May 2019, a contract member of staff from Weld-a-Rail tripped over rail in the four foot causing him to fall backwards and land on his back and elbow.  The work taking place was the installation and the required welding and clamping of a 9 metre (90 foot) rail at Vauxhall. The team completing this work were a Heavy Maintenance gang, working within a Network Rail managed possession (Item 21, London Waterloo to Queenstown Road). Whilst the contract Welder was working and stepping into the 4 foot, the Welder tripped on some scrap rail within the 4 foot and fell backwards on to the 10 foot side running rail.  His back came into contact with the running rail and the heel bar that he was holding came into contact with his right arm. No medical attention or first aid was given.  The Injured Person classed this as minor injury and continued to work with full duties. There was no lost time and no visit to GP or Hospital and the IP returned to full duties the following shift.  Immediate cause: The IP stepped over multiple scrap rails in the four foot while undertaking normal duties. The IP failed to fully clear all rails and lost footing, falling backwards, landing on their back.  IP was subsequently struck by a metal bar they were holding in their right hand. As the IP fell the IP lost grip of the bar and it landed on the IP.  Both events caused light pain and bruising.  Underlying cause: The site had been re railed and multiple rails were in the four foot of the road the IP was working on. This caused the underfoot conditions to be congested.

No hospital visit or first aid required although Section Supervisor would jointly compile a level 1 investigation form. While checking an OHL fault at Linlithgow Station a MOS sought to gain access to track using the route via the ""anti trespass boards"" at the platform end slope. Whilst doing this the MOS lost his footing on the boards, stumbled and fell flat on his back.  There was an access gate immediately adjacent where the accident took place, however, the gate was not used on this occasion and whilst investigating the accident the next day was found to be seized. There was 2 mos on the job, with 1 mos of staff witnessing the accident. The accident was captured on station cctv. From the cctv it was seen that the IP continued working after the accident, and indeed re-used the ""anti tresspass board"" route, which he fell on, to get to track level.  It was assumed that the same route was used in reverse to get back to platform level. The IP worked on after the accident but did not turn out for his next rostered shift.  IP was wearing the appropriate PPE, and was not carrying (manual handling) any significant load.  Further, on review of the accident, it was seen that the IP's colleague gained access to track level by sitting on the platform edge and bumped down the last few feet.  There was no evidence that the official access gate was flagged for maintenance nor previously ""close called"". It was unclear how long it had been seized.  Immediate cause:- Lost footing on an anti-trespass board whilst attempting to gain access to track level from station platform.

The IP had been sliding rail with other staff using rail dogs, the IP lost their footing and fell backwards. The IP continued work but stated their back was sore. NR2072p: On the 19th May 2019, the Woking Maintenance team had a planned rail defect (3A) removal at Surbiton. The work required to remove the defect consisted of replacing the defective rail with a new 35 foot long rail. The 4 man team on site for this work consisted of; A Woking based Network Rail Person in Charge, a Section Supervisor, the Injured Person and a Contract member of staff provided by Short Term. The team had to transport a rail from Esher to the site of work using a Road Rail Vehicle (RRV) and prior to carrying this out,  had to cut the required rail length (35 foot) off of a 700 foot long rail. To make the cut, the team had to move a 27 foot piece of rail that was obstructing the cutting point within the 4 foot.  The 4 man team on site had 2 sets of 'rail dogs' to pull the 27 foot rail and began to drag the rail out of the way, as opposed to lifting it and carrying it. This required an anticipated 3 pulls to clear the cutting point of the 700 foot rail. On the last pull of the 3, the 'rail dogs' slipped from the rail and the Injured Person fell backwards and landed on his back against the running rail.  He reported a slight pain in his lower back and was asked if hospital treatment was required, to which he said 'no' and was happy to continue with his shift carrying out lighter duties. The lighting on site was considered to be adequate for the work and was supplied by lighting from the adjacent car park and from head torches worn by the staff on track. The Section Supervisor was giving the instructions for the dragging movements to the team and the first two pulls took place without incident, on the third pull the 'dogs' slipped from the rail and this is when the accident occurred. The Section Supervisor identified that while he was controlling the pull, he had not checked with the team members that the 'dogs' had made solid contact with the rail prior to the pull and that the 'dogs' were potentially not gripping the rail sufficiently. The Section Supervisor identified that when work of this type is to be carried out in the future, the lead for the lift/pull should make sure that the team 'set' themselves prior to each and every movement, that all members of the team are prepared for the movement and that the lift/pull is carried out together. Immediate cause: The rail dogs being used by the Injured Person did not have a solid grip on the rail prior to carrying out the third pull of three. When the injured person then attempted to carry out the pull, they lost their balance and fell. Underlying cause 1: The lead for the pull had not checked with the team members that the 'dogs' had made solid contact with the rail prior to the pull and that the 'dogs' were potentially not gripping the rail sufficiently. Underlying cause 2: Time pressure to get the rail to site, get the work going and get the job done on time.  Remedial action 1: 'Take 5' to make sure the rail dogs are attached to the rail before pulling the rail.  Brief the teams to re-set each and every time that they are going to perform a movement, check that all members of the team are prepared for the movement, lift/pull together and if any member of the team is not ready to lift/pull, make sure that they speak up and stop the movement before it's too late.

The barriers then collapsed and the IP landed with the majority of weight on his forearm. The IP suffered with pain in his forearm and lower back. No first aid was required. NR2072p: In the early hours of Monday morning on the 27th May 2019 at approximately 03:15 hrs, a Wimbledon S&T Staff Member (an S&T Operative) was part of a three man Faulting Team investigating an alleged Wrong Side Failure (WSF) on W138 Signal. The works involved testing cables between Location Cases in the Durnsford Road area of Wimbledon on the Up Fast cess. This led the Team to WD21 Location Case at 06m 28ch of the Bournemouth Main Lines (BML1) at Wimbledon. Whilst the Team Leader & Technician were both checking/inspecting inside WD21 Location Case, the Operative, who was acting as their Site Warden, lent back against the Location Case guard barrier (which is in position to prevent staff inadvertently accessing the operational railway) which broke away at its base (made from a tubular construction and subject to corrosion) causing both the Operative and the guard barrier to fall to the ground, resulting in the Operative landing on his right forearm and suffering some pain to his lower back. No First Aid was required, but the Operative, who had suffered bruising/grazing to the forearm, was advised to leave the track-side by the On-Call Manager and the Team was requested to make the area safe, by removing the damaged barrier from the track, to prevent any further Staff coming into contact with this metal framework.  Immediate cause: The Operative leaning on the protective guard rail barrier which was not designed for this purpose.  The guard rail barrier gave way due to the barrier posts being severely corroded at the base and the Operative putting his body weight against it.  Underlying cause: The guard rail barrier was in good condition above the surface, but the area buried below ground was severely corroded. The current inspection regime or the discipline responsible for inspecting guard rail barriers at location cases was unclear and because of this, it had not been inspected.   Remedial action: Re-brief staff on the purpose of the guard barrier (not for leaning against or sitting on) and include this in the lessons learned notice produced by the WHSEA (Wessex Inner). Additionally a PIF was submitted for the guard barrier to be replaced/renewed. During routine maintenance inspections, Section 1.4 of NR/L3/SIG/10663 SIGNAL MAINTENANCE SPECIFICATIONS states that; as part of the external inspection staff should check (if provided) that any guarding or staging are secure. Therefore, S&T staff should be carrying out this inspection as part of the maintenance location case examinations.

Ref 0258.,"At 0415 a member of Doncaster DU Track staff reported from Barkstone Yard that one of his team (IP - Injured Person) had twisted their ankle whilst walking on the ballast during the process of loading the van after work was completed. The initial plan was for the IP to go home and sleep and be contacted later for update. At 1745 the Care Plan owner advised update for IP. The IP went to hospital as a precaution to get an X-ray, and confirmed no breaks but possibly some ligament damage (IP had previous for that) so was told to rest. IP was already booked off work until the next Wednesday. Immediate cause: IP fell whilst walking on uneven ground. Underlying cause:  A mixture of ballast & grass at side of cess causing ankle to turn causing injury. Remedial actions: Staff reminded to take care whenever working where it is uneven underfoot and to keep concentration following work tasks. Staff reminded to ensure they always undertake a thorough site safety brief, highlighting uneven areas and trip hazards. IP had declared a history of “turning ankles” therefore Section Manager (SM) to consider arranging medical assessment to identify if there was an underlying weakness in that area and implement any control measures to mitigate any re-occurrence or avoid any further aggravation. Safety boots were inspected, laced up fully and in good condition. Access point did not appear unduly uneven and was free of any obstructions, however the area was to be reviewed to see if any improvements could be made.

As the clip was being pulled the momentum caused him to move backwards and trip the over 6' leg, LH 1100 15.1160 and land on the ballast in the 6'.  Manpower on the job consisted of 2 people; the IP and a section supervisor.  The IP had 2 attempts at pulling in a clip. On the first attempt the IP demonstrated a good stance and technique. For some reason the clip didn't pull in( can happened if not lined up properly or slight burr), and at this point the IP decided to instantly, possibly instinctively, change his stance putting both heels  against the inside rail- creating a poor stance and technique. This poor positioning clearly meant that any backward momentum couldn't easily be overcome making a trip highly likely when coupled to both heels hard against the rail.  The fast clip puller was inspected and found to be in good condition. The IP was wearing appropriate PPE, including correct safety footwear. Ground conditions were normal for the section of track. Lighting in the working area was poor, with only head/hand lamps being used. The Ip had recent history of time off due to a known back aliment- sciatica. However, it is advised that this comes and goes and no medical issues were raised pre-shift start.  No first aid given at time of accident, however, it is advised that the IP walked off the job awkwardly/ gingerly/ungainly. Immediate cause:- Ip tripped whilst pulling in a Fast-Clip Underlying causes:- 1/ Poor stance and manual handling technique coupled to lack of  hazard situational awareness whilst pulling in a fast clip.  Ip put both feet against inside rail whilst pulling in the clip. 2/ Poor lighting on the job, hand lamps/head being used only. Opportunity missed to deploy new Solaris lighting or other site lights,  which would increased visibility on the job 10 fold +.

Once the possession was granted the team accessed the track at the double access gates to the rear of the Salkeld Street yard - AYR1, 0m0360y. The rail bogey was lifted to site and placed on the Down line ready to be loaded with the small plant and tools required for the job. A number of individuals were ferrying small plant from the pickup at the access gate to the rail bogey (which was now on track). When the IP reached the bogey with the tool he was carrying, he stepped over the cess rail into the 4ft. As his foot landed on the ballast it dislodged slightly, giving way under the IP's loaded foot. The result of this unplanned movement was a badly sprained left ankle. The area where the materials were being unloaded and transported to the bogey was lit by telescopic floodlights located on the back of the pickup (still to be transported to the bogey for use at site of planned works), the glow of the ambient streetlight and the light from the individual head torches worn by all members of the team on site. The IP was wearing Network Rail issued safety footwear and full PPE. A contributing factor uncovered during the initial investigation and IP interview is that the IP (male) is a shoe Size 6. This is apparently a source of embarrassment for the IP and he has been subject to teasing about it since a young age. Unbeknown to a large amount of people, the IP wears Size 8 safety boots in an attempt to counter the embarrassment. As a result, the IP has been working on the infrastructure with incorrectly sized safety boots, wearing three pairs of socks to fill out the voids left as a result of the size difference.

NR2072p: Whilst working at High cross on the WEYMOUTH LINE at 146M,11ch a contract member of staff from Cleshar sustained an injury walking Track Side in the CESS. He was part of a team tasked to correct 2 twist faults. He tripped over a Fishplate in the CESS that was difficult to see due to excess vegetation, and he then put out his arm to break his fall. As a result he dislocated his shoulder. The team had been working on site when the Yeovil P-Way Team Leader discovered that his Track Gauge was giving him false readings. On hearing this the IP informed the Team Leader that he had one in his van and then proceeded to go and get it. After a short period of time the Team leader spotted the IP returning with his Track Gauge, as the team Leader was waiting for him he looked round and spotted him lying in the undergrowth. Seeing this the Team Leader made his way to the IP and noticed that he had sustained a facial injury and had injured his left shoulder. After administering first aid all work was stopped and the IP was taken back to the van by the team to clean him up. He was then taken to Dorchester hospital by a member of the team,.

SCO42840,"The Injured Person (IP) and four other members of DJ Civils track squad were instructed to move a roll of Geo-textile at Kintore Level Crossing, Scotland North East.  The Geo-textile was previously left in the down Cess and was required on the opposite line. During a team lifting operation the Geo-textile was being maneuvered across the 4ft from the down Cess. The Down 4ft had new rail positioned awaiting future installation for the adjacent track. The team rolled the Geo-textile forward but it moved quicker than anticipated which caused one track worker to lose his balance and fall in the four foot onto the new rail. Initially the IP felt pain and discomfort and subsequently rested for a period of time and then felt able to continue with the remainder of his shift. Immediate cause - The IP and four man squad were lifting and shifting Geo-Textile, whilst lifting the Geo-Textile into the 4 he trip over and landed onto the rail (left hand side of body) which resulted in very minor brusing. Underlying cause - The 4 foot has restricted space due to addition rail (x2) be present within it and in addition with carrying the Geo-Textile made it difficult to visually or firmly  place a foot when the Geo-Textile rolled towards the IP. The task was also made more difficult as lighting relied solely on head torches whilst carry materials and stepping over rail in a an area that required addition lighting due to the environmental factors (darkness / restricted space). Materials (Geo-Textile) was rolled across the rails without ensuring that all the work party had a clear understanding (communication) of rolling the Geo-Textile over the rail with the requirement of ensuring that all persons are clear of the hazard. Remedial actions - Line side materials that are in an awkward position, bulky and heavy must be assessed prior to its movement and environment conditions (Lighting, Ground Conditions & Restricted Space) must be taken fully into account, stop-think-act-review, process to be completed.

This was as planned in the active Task Brief Sheet and the Work Package Plan. The first shift on site commenced on Monday 24 June at 23:00. A squad, including 3 painters and 2 welders, were briefed on the works for that night by Covanburn's site supervisor. A discussion was held as part of the briefing where it was agreed that a stair tread would be removed under high street working to determine the difficulty involved in removing the treads. This task was carried out by 2 welders. The removal of all treads from the platform 2 began once the line block was granted at 00:50. The method was to remove the treads one at at time, starting at the top tread progressing down the staircase. The platform was fully lit with all platform lighting switched on and portable lights where spread throughout the work site. Staff were made aware to be careful around platform 2. Painters were kept away from platform 2 whilst the welders removed each tread. At approximately 02:40, the IP was removing stair treads and noted that the cutting disk on his power tool required replacing.  He stopped work and proceeded to walk down the stairs. He went to step on the location where the tread had been removed and, as there was no tread there, his leg went through the gap between treads. The IP received a knock to his knee and was treated immediately by the on site first aider. The IP took a 30mins break and proceeded to walk off the pain. During this time he also took some paracetamol. After this break, the IP returned to his duties with the rest of the squad and finished his shift. The IP also returned to work for his next planned shift. The accident was recorded in the accident book after the IP had received treatment. The event was notified to Network Rail Control the following morning. Immediate cause:- stair Tread removed out of sequence. Underlying cause:- The tread that was removed could have been highlighted better by, for example, the use of warning tape. It is not common practice to remove a tread half way up a flight but in this case the welders, along with the site supervisor, wanted to remove one under High St Conditions to determine how easy it would be to remove the treads before the line blockage was in place. Remedial action:- The IP was briefed at the beginning of the shift of the risks involved in removing the treads. During the shift, the tread that was removed prior to the line block should have been replaced or highlighted.",Stepped,Metal,,"Freightliner Group, Network Rail",Infrastructure worker,,Error or violation,Failing to see or notice hazard,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

L1 form updates: Whilst out on the track on site visits marking up for the stone blower shifts in wk 23,  the IP was walking  in the 4ft in a published line block between UM202 Sig and UM199 Sig on the Up Main. The 4ft was full of old rails and as the IP was walking, taking his time walking when he had to step over the rails into the ballast beds that were low of ballast to reach a place of safety and twisted his ankle. The IP had a little rest in the Cess and moved his foot around to feel what movement he had. The IP carried on with the work but his ankle was sore. The IP contacted his line manager and the on call Supervisor and in the morning he contacted control. The IP was still a little sore but able to continue his duties.

It is not good enough to simply have a walkway and expect employees to navigate around obstructions whilst either walking or carrying tools and equipment, it must be kept clear with no obstructions. Employees also need to have ‘a see it, sort it’ attitude to ensure these and other work areas are kept clear. SCNA must satisfy themselves that regular inspections are conducted at vehicle access points and that suitable and sufficient access/egress is being maintained free from obstruction. 2/ Point of work risk assessment/maintaining individual awareness to changing underfoot conditions and obstructions: An underlying causation of this event is the IP not displaying personnel spacial awareness when walking on the rail infrastructure  Remedial actions -  1/ SCNA are to re-brief site teams that regular inspections of vehicle and pedestrian walkways are conducted and that all scrap materials should be collected and removed from the work-site immediately or as soon as is reasonably practicable.

No first aid was given on site and the MOM continued to work. When the MOM finished his shift he treated the soft tissue damage. No lost time confirmed. Immediate cause: The MOM stepped on a house brick lying in the cess and fell landing on his right leg. Underlying causes: Slip/lapse. The MOM had referenced Task Risk Control NR/L3/MTC/RCS0216/GH02 - Underfoot Conditions as one of the task risks relating to the job that required carrying out and ticked to confirm that all risk controls had been implemented. The first two risk controls in this standard are to 'always observe where you are walking' and 'look ahead to observe hazards and warn other members of the team'. The MOM had not observed that there were a number of loose bricks and rubble debris in the cess. This then led to him slipping on a house brick and falling over. The MOM had referenced 'Slips, Trips and Falls' as one of the location risks for the area and listed 'observe area being inspected' as the risk control and ticked to confirm it would be applied. The MOM had filled in an Incident Response Pack for the task as he was informed about the job less than a shift in advance. The job was not urgent and did not relate to any other ongoing incident that had occurred previously on the network. This meant it should have been planned in using a Safe Work Pack for a later date. The MOM would then be able to review the pack in advance and familiarise himself with the necessary task risk controls rather than preparing for it on the day in question. Remedial actions:  The MOM should ensure he is familiar with the controls relating to task risks he identifies to carry out the job in hand. He should familiarise himself with the risk controls before going out on or near the line and ensure he observes the route he wants to take before he starts walking. This will enable him to either walk around any hazards, remove any hazards likely to cause himself or other people issues when walking or find an alternative route to avoid walking in the cess if it is unsafe due to the amount of debris present. The MOM requires briefing on Task Risk Control Manual including NR/L3/MTC/RCS0216/GH02, the requirement for using it and how to apply the necessary controls to ensure his safety and the safety of those in the work group. The MOM should ensure he is familiar with the location he is working in and complete a visual scan of the area as far as he can see before going on or near the line. This will enable him to identify hazards and put a control in place before he walks through the area. He should then visually scan the route as he is walking in order to identify anymore hazards that could affect himself or others in the work group and make the necessary arrangements to avoid or rectify the hazard before he continues walking.  The MOM requires briefing on identifying location hazards, the requirement for doing it and how to implement the control measures effectively to ensure his safety and the safety of those in the work group. The MOM requires re-briefing on the 019 process and the difference between Incident Response Packs and Safe Work Packs.

Update from Level 1 Investigation: The IP was getting out the side of the van backwards and holding the hand grabs when he forgot the step was not working. The step in the van had been damaged the day  before by the 1400-2200 team when driving down an access to track.  The bottom of the step was hit causing it to bend upwards which prevented it from sliding out when the side door opened.   It was reported to the manager of the night team and then the night team told the day team all with the same instructions that the van was usable but just remember there was no step. The IP stepped down without looking, expecting the step to be there and when putting his foot down he put all his weight onto his right ankle twisting it.

The IP fell onto his right elbow and sustained a cut to his elbow which he believed was caused by a nail partially protruding from the broken pallet. The IP, accompanied by a colleague, visited the Turners Yard compound where the cut was cleaned and a bandage was applied. The IP reported the issue to the Godfrey Road offices and was fit to continue his shift. Level 1 report: A sub-contracted operative working for M J Hughes on behalf of Balfour Beatty sustained a cut to his right elbow following a lineside trip and fall event. The IP was tasked with carrying out material checks for the OLE materials team in preparation for the night shift works. The IP arrived on site at the Redwick RRAP access point in Magor at around 13:30, accompanied by a second operative. The IP was taking a photo of the material when he stepped on a broken pallet, causing him to lose his footing, trip and then fall. The IP fell on his right arm and sustained a cut to his elbow which was believed to have been caused by a partially protruding nail on the broken pallet. The IP then egressed the Redwick site, heading to the Turners Yard compound on the opposing side of the track. At Turners Yard first aid supplies were available which the IP utilised to clean the cut and apply a bandage dressing. The IP felt fine beyond the extent of the cut and headed back to the Godfrey Road offices as the current shift tasks had been completed. The IP reported the issue to the Godfrey Road offices, provided a statement and was fit to continue with their shift. Immediate cause: The IP tripped over a broken pallet causing them to lose their footing and fall to the ground, sustaining a cut injury to their right elbow. Underlying cause: The IP was in the process using their mobile phone to take a photograph of the material. This was carried out whilst walking and without focusing on where they were stepping or their surroundings. The use of their mobile phone was a distraction which lead to the individual stepping onto the debris instead of being aware and avoiding the obstacle. Remedial action: When taking photos on site ensure that staff are standing still and not walking.  Underlying cause: The two operatives failed to carry out a sufficient 'Take 5' safety analysis or point of work risk assessment to identify the hazards on site and the adequate controls required. This practice would have enabled the workgroup to identify the miscellaneous construction debris on the site, proceed to close call the issue and take close out action by means of removing any obstructive or hazardous items. An adequate assessment of the site was not undertaken. Remedial action: Staff to take 5 before starting work to ensure that the work area is safe to work in. Underlying cause: The location, Redwick in Magor, is a Network Rail authorised access point consisting of a RRAP and material or plant lay down area. This site is not under BBR control and is utilised by multiple contractors, accessed by means of a standard rail clip lock key. The site had seen waste materials and construction debris being left at a previous date by unknown contractors. Amongst these items was a broken pallet. Several parties would have used this location without this object being identified and removed. Furthermore, this site is small in size and very congested from plant and material. Remedial action: The BBR compounds team were informed and attended the site on the following day to collect and remove any loose waste, material and debris. All sites to be kept clean with the skips utilised to segregate and take away the waste from the project.

There had been intermittent rain during the shift.  The operative was positioned so that he had one foot on the suspended section and one on the fixed beam. As the suspended section started to move the operative lost his footing and fell approximately 0.5 to 1 meter to a  fixed beam. The operative let go of the fixed beam and was suspended in his harness but the inertia from the fall was insufficient to deploy the fall arrest lanyard. The fixed beams were positioned above the re-constructed wall and he was suspended just below the top of the wall. Other operatives pulled him to a position of safety.  The operative only received a minor graze to his back and wanted to return to work. The JMS site supervisor stood him down as a precaution.  Immediate cause: Movement of the cantilever scaffold section being lifted out. The section of scaffold being lifted from the support beams was still trapped at one end allowing the free end to rotate outward. The scaffold operative returned to the fixed end and tried to release it from the supporting beam. When the load was released it jerked outward, as it was under tension, and caused the scaffold operative to lose his balance and fall into the gap created. Underlying cause: The scaffold section was under tension while the scaffold operative was trying to release it. The scaffold operative had one foot on the section to be lifted out. Although the scaffold was wet due to rain the IP was wearing suitable footwear and this wasn't a contributing factor. The slinger/signaler was not on the scaffold but communicating verbally with his team on the fixed beams. Remedial action: Brief all CREs and project team to consider the following points: The positioning of the support beams at the design stage to allow easier release when removing.  More detail in WPP and TBs relating to dismantling of temporary works.  Not just a reversal of the installation  process.  Ensure the all the required competencies are in place on site and fulfilling their duties fully. Improve communications by the using duplex radios.

The vehicle, which was parked at the access point at 97M 1276Yds Colethorpe Lane U/B. The IP removed the Cembre drill from the skate and folded the skate up. The IP stated that he put the Cembre drill on his right shoulder and was holding it by the carrying handle.  He carried the skate in his other hand over the up main as the access was on the down main. It had been raining and the ground was muddy and a bit slippery. The IP had walked up the access path a number of times that night with no issues. The access point was not lit and only cap lamps were being used. The IP stated that he walked down the right side of the access track as there was waste dumped on the left side. The access was more like a track with grass down the middle of it, roughly three quarters of the way down the track the IP slipped and his right foot went forward, causing the Cembre drill on his right shoulder to tip backwards. He let go of the skate and fell backwards. He did not have time to let go of the Cembre drill prior to falling to the ground. The momentum of the Cembre drill on his right shoulder forced the IP's hand further back, overextending his shoulder. The IP aggravated his shoulder as he went to get up from the ground. The IP stated that he had hurt his shoulder in a motorcycle accident approximately 7 years ago. The IP was covered in mud from the fall and picked up the Cembre drill and the skate and proceeded to his vehicle approximately 20ft away from the fall. The IP did not tell anyone from High Output on site that he had a fallen, neither the SAC when he signed out/ left site. The IP got back home between 06:30-07:00. He sat down for a while and noticed that his radius bone was raised more than normal. The IP then informed MECX by email to let them know of the incident and went to bed to rest. The IP got an appointment at the local surgery the following day.  The nurse advised the IP to rest and take paracetamol/ Ibuprofen for the pain. The IP did not attend any A&E for an X-Ray. MECX Health and Safety rep. tried to contact the IP on the day of the Incident, he followed up the next day 30-08-2019 and then several times on the Monday 2nd September.  The IP did not reply to any calls or emails from MECX. The IP finally contacted MECX H&S due to his phone being left elsewhere. The IP declared himself fit to work on the 09-09-2019. The IP has completed Manual Handling training on the 13-02-2019. The IP had completed a High Output Induction (30-08-2018) Immediate cause - The IP slipped on the wet access path when egressing the track. Underlying cause –  No lighting was installed at this access point. No close calls were raised reference the site access. The IP did not inform his employer (MECX) that he had a previous Injury. He was asked by MECX whether he had any previous Injuries that would stop him carrying out his duties. Due to the length of time that had passed with no recurrence he stated no. The access track was wet from an earlier downpour. Remedial action –  Site lighting to be ordered for all sites going forward. The IP to be encouraged to raise close calls on all High Output Worksites. The IP to inform his employer of all accidents and incident which have occurred previously to warn of any issues. The need to ""Take 5"" to assess conditions has been briefed as part of several recent period safety briefs, and the underfoot conditions hazard routinely included in task briefs. Unsafe act - The IP carrying two pieces of equipment at one time on a slippery access point.  Was the action deliberate – Yes. He chose to carry the skate and the Cembre drill together to reduce the amount of walking required. Was the action well intentioned – Yes. To get the task completed in one journey. Informed about procedures – Yes. The IP fully understood the consequences of his action which led to the fall.  He stated that he should have carried the equipment separately down the access, which might have of prevented a fall. Procedures clear & workable - The IP was advised during the investigation that he should carry the equipment in a safe manner and not overload himself. Unsafe act - The COSS allowed the IP to work alone, outside his supervision. Was the action deliberate – Yes. The COSS allowed the IP to leave the workgroup to return tools to the van. Was the action deliberate – Yes. The action was intended to allow efficient completion of the work on site. Informed about procedures – Yes. The individual held a COSS competence and was aware of the need to keep the workgroup with him by virtue of that competence. Procedures clear & workable – Yes. It would have been possible for the whole workgroup to stay together and return to the van together when the work was completed. Outcome – Contravention. Unsafe act - The IP did not follow the correct procedure for reporting all accident and Incidents as per the High Output Induction. Was the action deliberate – Yes. It was a deliberate choice to report or not to do so. Was the action well intentioned – Yes. The IP evidently did not believe that the injury needed to be reported on site, but since he reported it to MECX later this cannot be concluded to have any ill intent. Informed about procedures – Yes. The IP received a High Output induction which emphasised the requirement for incidents to be reported on 30-08-2019. Procedures clear & workable – Yes. The ES and COSS were on site, and the HSEA on call number was widely publicised as well as being included in the induction. Outcome – Contravention.

Cause - uneven ballast. NR2072P: On the 30th of August 2019, a Technician from Wimbledon P-Way was part of a team pushing a 30ft rail on an Iron Man from the London end of Earlsfield towards country.  The rail was to be delivered to 6m78ch for future works. During this process, the Technician caught his foot in a small ballast hole and rolled his ankle. The team were carrying out the task at night, using only head torches for lighting, despite there being RiteStar 700 NightSearcher magnetic lights available. These lights were specifically purchased for use with the Iron Men and/or trolleys. The underfoot conditions present (ballasted track) were exacerbated by the presence of tamping holes which had not been regulated (boxed in) during the tamping process or addressed afterwards.  This was formally a common practice on the railway, but due to diminishing numbers of staff, it is no longer carried out.  As the 4 men team were pushing the Iron Men along the Up Main Slow, from 4m33ch to 6m78ch, the Technician's foot caught within one of the tamping holes and he rolled his ankle. The Technician, who is a qualified First Aider, took the appropriate P.R.I.C.E. (Protect, Rest, Ice, Comfort and Elevate) actions for the type of injury suffered once it was possible to do so. These actions potentially reduced the exacerbation of the injury and the Technician suffered only minor swelling to the ankle. The Technician suffered a one day lost time injury and was able to return to work for the following shift. Immediate cause: As the Technician was pushing the Iron Man along the Up Main Slow, he came into contact with an area of uneven ballast. Underlying cause: The ballast along the Up Main Slow had been previously tamped and not regulated either during or after this process. The lighting provided by the head torches was not sufficient for the task being carried out and did not illuminate the potential hazards on track. Remedial actions: The area should be regulated either manually or mechanically.  The Team were re-briefed by the Section Manager on the RiteStar 700 NightSearcher lights which were available and had been bought for use with both Iron Men and track trolleys.",,,,Network Rail,Infrastructure worker,,The person's environment,Surface condition,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

DU Shrewsbury S&T staff sprained ankle walking on ballast at Llandudno Jcn,"A member of Llandudno S&T sprained his  right ankle whilst walking on ballast. Person taken to hospital for checks. The IP was working as part of a S&T team undertaking fault response / fault finding of the signalling equipment.  This involved working in the down side sidings at the west end of Llandudno Junction Station. The works were being undertaken using a line block of the sidings, along with line blocks of both the up and down roads. The IP was walking from the siding to the Up Cess, however, the walking route was obstructed with vegetation. There was a road over bridge at this location, with piers situated in the cess and 10 foot (wideway). As the walking route was obscured by vegetation, the IP chose to step up onto a raised pile cap which supported the bridge pier. He walked from one side of the pile cap to the other a distance of approx 1m, then stepped down from the elevated pile cap to the cess level, a height difference of approx. 500-600mm. As his left foot met the ballast in the stepping down action, his ankle twisted resulting in the injury. The IP was wearing correct safety boots in the high leg configuration.  It is believed that this high leg configuration provided additional support to the ankle, preventing a more serious injury. (ORIGINAL REPORT - The IP whilst walking in the up cess twisted his ankle and fell over on to the ballast whilst trying to avoid some vegetation near LJ69 signal. The work activity he was undertaking was fault finding, to repair an earth fault to the near by signalling equipment.)

EM057,"At 2215 whilst loading a flat back vehicle with TGA machines, the Injured Person (IP), a Leicester based Mobile Operations Manager, stepped off the vehicle onto cables which caused him to slip, twisting his left ankle. PRICE protocol implemented. IP was initially taken home, and then on to hospital (Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham). At 0010 the IP advised he was in A&E awaiting x-ray (estimated waiting time of 7 hours) and would update on discharge. RCM would arrange transport to take IP home as he was unable to drive. The IP had a sprained ankle and would be off work for 2 weeks. Update from Level 1 Investigation: IP (Mobile Operations Manager) was working in Leicester PSB yard with 3 colleagues loading a flat bed vehicle with traction gel machinery and equipment in readiness to go to site for installation works. After completing the loading of the vehicle the IP stepped down from rear corner of flat back pickup after securing load (descending sideways), stepped onto cables on the ground and slipped on the cables and kerb edging causing bad sprain to ankle. IP was taken to hospital and an X-ray was taken. No broken bones but badly bruised and sprained. The IP did not see the black cabling on the floor prior to stepping off the vehicle as lighting was minimal. IP was not lifting at the time and the flatbed vehicle steps were not used due to how the vehicle had been load organised. Immediate Cause IP stepped from back of flatbed lorry onto cables left on the ground causing him to slip and consequently injuring his ankle. Underlying Causes Work zone area was not adequate due to cabling left in area and not highlighted prior to loading and working in the area, also lighting was minimal which prevented the IP seeing the cables on floor prior to stepping off vehicle. IP did not use the steps on the vehicle to descend due to the way the vehicle had been loaded, this would have meant climbing onto and over equipment and was felt this was more a risk than descending direct off the vehicle. Remedial Actions Safety conversations / alert  to staff to ensure they were aware of the requirements and responsibilities to ensure area should be fit for work - ensuring adequately lit during loading / unloading operations, using portable or hand held lighting if required, the working zone is free from obstructions.  Safety conversations / alert  to staff to ensure that planning into how the vehicle will be loaded incorporates the access strategy for access and egress for staff with a view to ALWAYS using the steps.  No further investigation was required. Welfare of individual to be managed, on return to work a full reconstruction of this incident was carried out, this to confirm the existing learning and cascade to all other staff that would benefit from these lessons learned and safety conversations to be completed.

The IP slipped on burnt and damp scrap wood causing them to fall in to brambles. NR2072p: An Operative working for Woking P-Way as part of a patrolling team consisting of the Patrolman (Person in Charge) and the Lookout (Operative) were walking from Byfleet & New Haw to Addlestone on the 7th October 2019 on the Down Chertsey. The Operative was acting as site lookout for the patrolman.  The team were approaching the River Wey bridge at 20m 08ch where a line blockage was due to be taken. When they got to the bridge they stepped out into the position of safety so the PIC could take the line blockage.  Whilst stepping into the position of safety in the Down cess the Operative stepped down the bank and thought he was stepping onto the troughing but there was a piece of wood which looked like it was decking or guard boarding from the bridge and which was overgrown with brambles so was difficult to see. The Operative's foot slipped off the wood and he fell and banged his ankle and fell onto the brambles in which he got some thorns in his wrist and legs.   The Operative was able to continue to the next station and suffered no long lasting injury. Immediate cause: Operative stepped into a position of safety and was unable to identify potential hazards. Underlying cause: Scrap wood decking hidden by overgrown vegetation, Wet weather.  Remedial action: The Section Supervisor advised staff to keep an eye out for hidden items in vegetation and to take extra care whilst walking through/into overgrown vegetation.

AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor had completed the Whiteboard briefing of the works to be carried out on the night and other documentation. Subcontractor Masonry Solutions were tasked with general masonry pointing works to the bridge and were put to work. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor then returned to his welfare van to carry out further paper work. One task was to record the mileage of his welfare van. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor exited the welfare compartment and walked round the front of his van to the driver door. As he turned right at the front of the van towards the driver’s door, his footing has given way on the vegetation (possibly into a a small channel hidden by overgrown vegetation) which caused a sharp pain in his right hip. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor went down on the ground due to the pain and after a couple of minutes got to his feet where he felt pain in his right hip. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor thought nothing of this and continued with the planned works for the night. Did not report as an accident to anyone and was not observed by anyone else on site. Works were completed and AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor returned to the Irvine Depot to arrange equipment for the following shift and traveled home (Clydebank). 8th October 2019 – Tuesday Night Shift: When AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor woke later in the day he did not feel pain till he put pressure on his right side when standing up and walking. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor took this to be the result of a knock to his right hip area and thought the pain would ease during the day and thought nothing of it and felt this did not require to be reported to his line manager. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisors wife advised him to attend hospital to get his injury checked but he felt that it was only a knock and he would be fine in a couple of days. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor went to work that evening/night to carry out the works required at the structure. Remaining Works (9th - 11th October 2019): AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor went about his works over the week and completed the works to the structure by Friday morning. On the Friday morning AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor felt that the pain was still as sore as when his footing gave way on the Monday night and attended A&E. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor was expecting to be in for approx. 20 mins but after the x-ray results came back, he was advised that he had sustained a right intracapsular neck of femur fracture on his right hip. The surgeon advised on the pre-op consultation that AmcoGiffen Supervisor had been unfortunate with the injury he received. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor had emergency surgery on the Friday at aprox.14:00hrs. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor was discharged on the Saturday morning as he was doing well with mobility on crutches. AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor returned to work on Monday 14th October using crutches. At this point his line manager questioned what had caused him to be on crutches and the supervisor relayed the events above. Note: Weather Conditions at time of incident were dry underfoot condition with no rain. Note: There was sufficient lighting provided by; 4 x Peli Lights, Head torch and vehicle lights. Note: AmcoGiffen Site Supervisor had parked on the tarmac next to the grass/vegetation and had on numerous occasions walked on the area without incident that night.

[SCO44178] IP-Western & Crossrail,"A Taziker Industrial Operative was walking from one side of Bletchington bridge to the other carrying timber when he slipped on muddy embankment, fell over and bumped his head on the structure. A minor cut was sustained and he was taken to A&E before returning to work. The works at Bletchington over bridge involved the undertaking of numerous masonry repairs to the underneath of each span. Works to span 1 and 3 were undertaken during midweek days within a high street environment, whilst works to span 2 were carried out during possessions. Materials and equipment for the Saturday night possession works were kept underneath span 3. On the south east corner of the structure between span 3 and 2 there was a small embankment less than 2m in length and at an angle of around 25 degrees. During the shift, as well as previous shifts, this had been used as one of the access routes to and from span 3 to collect materials during possession works. At approximately 02:30 the IP left the work area in span 2 to collect a number of timber slats. Whilst walking up to span 3 via the embankment the IP lost his footing and fell. This resulted in the IP's  hard hat falling off and his face hitting the brickwork of the structure and sustaining a cut above his left eye. The site first aider and site manager cleaned out the cut and held pressure on it using supplies from the site first aid box. The IP was then taken to the nearest A&E where his cut was treated and glued together. The IP returned to work following the hospital visit and finished the shift without any further incident. The IP also attended work the following day (14/10/19). Workload - According to the IP he was not rushing or under pressure to get the job done. Lighting - Task lighting was provided in the area, according to the IP's statement the area where he slipped was not dark and he had good visibility of the area due to task lighting, as well as his personal head torch. Weather - According to the IP's statement there was heavy rainfall during the shift, which resulted in the usually safe access route becoming muddy and slippery.  Fatigue - According to the IP, he did not feel tired/fatigued at the time of the incident occurring or beforehand. IP PPE suitable - The IP was wearing suitable safety footwear with ankle protection, mid-sole and steel toe cap. Immediate cause - The IP slipped on the muddy embankment whilst walking from span 2 to 3. Underlying cause - There was heavy rain during the shift, which deteriorated the outer access routes to span 3. This access route was considered a suitable and safe walking route to transport materials to and from span 3, however due to the poor weather conditions it became muddy and slippery. Remedial action - Action 1 - The access routes either side of span 3 were blocked off and the archway in between the piers at span 3 used instead. This route is protected from weathering by the structure. Other walking routes around site have also been inspected to ensure they are safe. Action 2 - Incident bulletin sent out to all TI sites to share lessons learnt and warn that access routes deemed safe in 'good weather conditions' can become unsafe during periods of heavy downpours. Unsafe act - The IP slipped on the muddy embankment. Was the action deliberate - No. The IP did not intentionally fall nor perceive that the embankment was a slip/trip risk. Informed about procedures - Yes. The IP had received a task briefing for the works he was undertaking. Procedures clear & workable - No. Due to the severe weather conditions, the access routes condition deteriorated resulting in the normal procedure becoming unsafe. Would others have done the same - Yes. The embankment had been used by a number of operatives throughout the shift without incident.

The IP was the COSS and was walking to the site with (Ipad only) to gather information and identify any hazards at the site before bringing material, equipment and other staff to site. COSS brief already took place prior to this but the COSS also walked the site to make sure that there were no other hazards that he may have missed from his brief. When walking the site the IP observed the condition of the ground and noticed a small gully which he then went to step over. When stepping over with IP left foot first, his right foot gave way into another small gully and he then felt something pop in his calf on his right leg. Following the injury, the IP went to the local hospital where it was suggested that he had injured his calf muscle.  This was then followed up by discussion with the IPs Section Manager and follow up visits to the IPs own GP. Initial diagnosis was a suspected tear. This was then downgraded to sprain / strain by the IPs own GP. Immediate cause -Underfoot conditions being the main cause of injury resulting in supporting foot concealed depression. Underlying cause  -Environment is the main factor here. agriculture land where small gullies , rabbit holes , uneven ground hidden within the gorse/vegetation/long grass. Level of ground is on a gradient where it goes from low to high. No materials or equipment had been carried. It was only the IP walking the site with his IPAD that he was carrying. IP wasn't using IPAD and walking. IP knows to only use IPAD when in a static position.  Remedial actions - * Staff being provided and using walking poles as support to mitigate risk of STF on uneven and concealed surfaces. * Potential use of technology to conduct scoping works in areas of limited access or gradients relevant to vegetation cover and railway regulations. * Training on proprioception / safely access and egressing sites. * Take 5 to visually assess and dynamically risk assess. * Full PPE check including boot sizing (fit for purpose) and walking aids.",Level,Other: earth,,Network Rail,Infrastructure worker,,The person's environment,Surface condition,0.01,Workforce (on-duty): Severe 7

The injured person (a Senior Engineering Technician) was walking from the track infrastructure to the egress point at Addlestone Junction Bridge and slipped on the wooden timber decking, falling onto their lower back. Anti-slip matting (or a suitable substitute such as Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP)) was not present throughout the length of the wheel timber bridge and this made the surface very slippery, which was exacerbated due to the weather conditions on the day, which were drizzly and damp. Following the accident, the team involved raised a Fault Maintenance Service (FMS) request (454933) to have the bridge treated with anti-slip matting however, due to their location, the injury could not be immediately dealt with.  The Senior Technician was able to continue with his shift and return to work the following day.  Immediate cause: The injured person was traversing a wheel timber bridge that did not have anti-slip matting present.   Underlying cause: Poor weather conditions (drizzling rain and damp underfoot) exacerbated the slippery nature of the wheel timber bridge surface.

Immediate Cause Poor ground conditions at access gate i.e. tripping hazard, kerb in shadow. Kerb was higher than both the tarmac and the rough pathway hence was easily tripped over. IP walked through narrow access gate and did not take due care and did not notice the raised kerb so tripped over it. Underlying Causes This was a staff car park for the station, without public access, hence the old wooden fence was apparently regarded as an adequate boundary, although now leaning over. It had 4 small gates originally for loc cabinets, only one still present, which were used as general access points and three double gates. However the cess was somewhat overgrown and there were no proper access paths onto the track (Nottingham West Jn S&C). Remedial Actions Initial: Check access points along this section, several with similar conditions in close proximity. Ultimate solution would be to truncate the car park at its required length, erect palisade fencing along the cess to this point and then continue the fence across the car park incorporating a double gate. Then remove all wooden fencing/gates, clear vegetation and level the ground to enable access from vehicles where required.",Sloped,Other: Earth,,Network Rail,Infrastructure worker,,Error or violation; The person's environment,Failing to see or notice hazard; Surface condition,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

Weather conditions were poor, falling rain wet & heavy fog. The IP slipped within the 4ft of the Strand road dock line which was immediately adjacent the the egress point. The slip resulted in the IP twisting his ankle & jarring his knee as a result of the transverse direction of the slip. Once back at the site, the pain eased and no hospital treatment or time off work was expected. Immediate cause: IP Stepped onto the wet sleeper end of the 6ft rail leading him to fall awkwardly into the 4ft of the strand road line.

He worked on but experienced swelling in his knee and was taken to hospital as a precautionary measure. Investigation finding - It was noticed that the bolts securing the flooring were causing a tripping hazard. The bolts needed to be installed like this in order to keep the flooring secure. There was black matting over some of the bolts to prevent tripping injuries however due to the amount of traffic over them the matting had slipped. Immediate cause - The immediate causation, was the S&T Installer tripping over a protruding fastening designed to hold down aluminium floor covering in the vehicle waiting area. Underlying cause - The flooring had to be bolted down in order to keep it secure, however this solution left the bolts and clamps sticking out 'proud' and creating a trip hazard. Rubber matting was not placed over joints to prevent tripping hazards developing due to the undulation of the ground condition and weight of motor vehicles.

First aid: No  Lost time: No Cause: Thick cables in walking route NR2072P: A member of Woking Signals and Telecommunications (S&T) suffered a 'slip, trip & fall' accident when egressing track. The injured person (IP) who is an experienced member of staff, had been called out to a fault relating to 2236 points in Woking Junction. After rectifying the fault, the IP crossed from the points to secure a location box at the side of the track between the down sidings and Days Aggregate stone yard.    Having crossed the sidings to get from the ballast to the troughing the IP had to traverse a series of thick power cables laid in the cess. Stepping on these  cables the IP slipped backwards onto the ballast, landing with his right shoulder and arm taking the brunt of the impact. The IP finished his shift and no work was lost.  Control was informed as was the S&T manager.  No first aid administered as there was no ice packs available to reduce swelling. Immediate cause: The IP was stepping from ballast to troughing Underlying causes: There were a number of thick power cables laid along the cess and not contained in anyway. First-aid was not provided as there were no ice-packs available to apply to the inured area to reduce the swelling.   Remedial actions: Cables should be surveyed to see if they can be contained in some way (e.g. troughing or conduit), marked up or anything else to mitigate a similar occurrence in the future.

These steps had been used throughout the 4-day blockade and were lit and gritted. A Readypower Machine Operator,  who was finishing shift, missed the last step on the way down and banged their right knee on the concrete step. They were taken to A&E Hammersmith & Fulham Hospital and diagnosed with a chipped bone on their right knee. The steps were checked and found to be all in order. 03:00 Update on Accident - Staff member has had an X-Ray and has chipped his right knee. Currently in a brace and has been escorted back to his hotel room. On call have been informed and arrangements are in place to get him home tomorrow. Immediate cause - The IP was walking down the concrete access steps with one hand on the railing and was carrying a bag in the other hand, but missed the last step resulting in a fall to the ground. Underlying cause - Though the access area had been illuminated during darkness hours and the IP was wearing a head torch he did not see a final step, which resulted in his fall to the floor. It was noted that the IP had not been given permission to leave site by management so he was potentially moving quickly down the steps in order to leave the worksite unnoticed. Remedial action - Taking care to move down the steps and maintaining three points of contact at all times whilst looking in the direction of travel may have prevented this accident from occurring. During mobilisation works, all access points need to be checked to ensure they are fully illuminated to mitigate any risk of slip, trip and fall due to dark areas.  It was noted however that this particular area, was illuminated and had been used for the previous 70 hours without any incident or report of poor lighting from any person on site. Unsafe act - IP had left site without authorisation from Project Management team. Was the action deliberate - Yes. It was anticipated that the IP had attempted to leave site prior to the end of his planned shift as the works he had been deployed for had been completed. Was the action well intentioned - Yes. Other site operatives had left the worksite at a similar time, the IP had made a decision that this also meant he would leave site early rather than seeking out Project Management for further instructions.

First aid was not administered but monitored by the team, stayed in digs locally. The IP was able to complete his shift. At the time of the accident he was wearing full PPE. Updates from L1: the IP was using an IRATA rope system to clear vegetation from a sheer cutting face. Rope had been set up and assessed by a level 3 Supervisor. The IP was trying to reach (to his right) an area of uncut vegetation and so was at maximum horizontal reach on anchor line. Due to rock cutting being wet with loose rock and wet vegetation the IP lost his footing and the rope pulled him in an uncontrollable manner back to the centre line - but in the process the IP got rotated 180 degrees and was pulled towards the rock face hitting his left arm hard on rock. No lost time and only elbow injury. Immediate cause - Underfoot conditions were slippery (wet veg, ivy / loose rock) plus operative (IP) was stretching to his right to clear an area of ivy from cutting face. IP's feet slipped and he lost control - rope tension pulled him back to wall/rock whilst being rotated 180 degrees. Underlying cause - Operative (IP) moved line from anchor to go around another stump to get more line to the right to get to a new uncleared area. IP reached and stretched to reach new area but lost footing due to underfoot conditions. As tension on the line was at maximum, the pendulum effect caused IP to swing in an uncontrolled manner.

Level 1 report: IP was moving his car which was parked in a public place at around 17:05 to create room for the signaller relieving him at 18:00. He left the box without noting in the TRB and letting the other signallers know. After he had moved his car, he got out of his vehicle and walked around the other side of the car near the hedge to clean the wing mirror. As he was walking round his right leg slipped forward on mud causing his legs to split and he fell onto his back. He over stretched the area by his right hip and thinks he's strained that area. He reported the accident to control and had phoned in sick for the next 3 days. He took Zapain when he got home which meant he couldn't work alone for the duration of the medication and a further 48 hours after the last dose. He was offered Physiotherapy with Rehab works but declined the offer and is returned to work on 15/02/20. He had 3 rest days before the accident and worked 48 hours in the 7 day period with no overtime worked so I believe fatigue wasn't a factor.  Immediate cause: Slipping on mud next to parked car.

First aid treatment was not administered. The IP got to their feet, brushed themselves down and carried on undertaking their normal duties. A short time after (circa 10 minutes), the IP began to have pain in the areas of impact i.e. left hand side ribs and forearm. They subsequently reported this to their line manager. The IP was taken to hospital as a precaution, after the triage nurse assessed them, they advised the IP that there was no treatment they could offer, just advice - light duties and pain killers, if required. The IP returned to their normal Site Manager duties after the hospital visit.  Immediate cause: slipped on wet ground whilst entering the site cabin, causing the IP to fall to the ground.   Underlying cause: the IP was visiting site to complete a check of the water levels, which were high due to Storm Dennis. The ground was wet due to the storm, which may have increased the likelihood of a slip, even though appropriate footwear was being worn. The IP was thinking about the weather and how it was impacting the programme of works and was distracted. When the IP fell, they held onto their camera satchel which they were carrying to photograph the site conditions, meaning that they may not have broken their fall, as they otherwise would have.

The team consisted of an Network Rail (NR) Controller of Site Safety (COSS), 2 x Renown welders and 6  x Vital operatives. The injured Party  (IP)  was one of the Vital Members of Staff (MoS). The weather at the time was very poor with wet  with heavy rain and strong winds. This was the only job in the area that night not to be cancelled due to the bad weather as these works were being carried out in the tunnel which provided protection from the elements due to its enclosed nature. Prior to the shift commencing a briefing was carried out by the COSS at South Gyle NR depot and again on site at the access point at Abbeyhill. Sentinel cards were scanned at approx 00:45 and site specific hazards of slips, trips, falls and underfoot conditions and designated walking route to and from work site (within 4ft)  were identified and briefed to the work group. The lighting for access and egress to the work site was cap lamps, which all the work party had and were all in working order. There was additional lighting which was erected at site of work to illuminate the work area. When the works were completed the team  proceeded to walk out of the tunnel back towards the access point. Shortly after exiting the tunnel the IP subsequently slipped after steeping/walking on the ends of wooden sleepers and cut his leg on a track screw. The IP choose to  walk on the sleepers, instead of walking ballast to ballast within the 4ft. This walking route was highlighted and all  rail staff are taught/informed that you should not walk on rails and sleepers as part of every Personal Track Safety (PTS) training course. Due to the adverse weather the underfoot conditions had become extremely wet which increased the risk of slipping. The IP has over 3 and half years experience of working on the railway and should have known not to walk on sleepers.   First aid was applied at the access point and upon further examination it was decided that A&E treatment was required. He was then driven to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary A&E for further treatment where they arrive at approx 06:00.This resulted in the IP receiving 9 x stitches. The IP claims to have been left alone after a visit to the toilet which made him panic and rush/run through the tunnel to catch up with the team and insists this was an underlying cause of his fall but CCTV and other witness statements including the COSS do not back this statement up. This was the IPs last shift working with Vital as he had handed in his notice because he had accepted an offer of employment out with the rail industry.   Immediate cause-  Falling onto track  Underlying cause - Walking on wet sleeper ends Not adhering to the COSS briefing which detailed designate walking route to and from site of work (Within 4ft) Not following designated competence PTS for not walking on rails and sleepers. Remedial actions - 1.

They fell and cracked two ribs [SCO45913],"PA - Works Delivery MOS was clearing debris from a culvert near Weston Milton when they slipped on a cast iron pipe running through culvert. They fell and cracked two ribs. Update - Back in work but not heavy lifting. The IP did not immediately make D&B personnel aware of his incident or injury. At the time the D&B SHEQ advisor was also present, having just received a site induction and reviewed the documentation, the SHEQ advisor was conversing with one of the drainage personnel regard fire extinguishers when the IP approached and listened in to the conversation and again, did not mention any incident. The main reason why the SHEQ advisor was present on this day was to obtain a statement from one of the drainage personnel who had sustained a minor head injury only the day before while installing the GRP, on the same inlet culvert work site. It was only during the taking of this statement that the IP decided to inform the D&B supervisor who immediately brought the IP to the welfare vehicle and informed the SHEQ advisor. The IP stated he thought he had broken a couple of ribs and was going to be conveyed to the local A&E hospital at Weston-S-Mare. This then took place. When the IP returned approximately an hour and half later he stated the hospital doctor had given him an x-ray and had stated the IP had fractured the two top ribs on his right chest. The hospital had given the IP Oramorph, co-codamol, ibuprofen and paracetamol to ease the pain and an information leaflet regard chest Injury as there was nothing else they could do for fractured ribs, these were treated the same as soft tissue injury. The IP did not see the x-ray result or receive any confirmatory letter regarding the fractures and D&B are still waiting for actual evidence of this, prior to recording as a potential RIDDOR. Also on his return to site, the IP, on finding out the works were on stop, after providing a statement in his words of the events pertaining to the incident, he joined his Arch colleagues in the demobilisation of the works and pumping activities. He was observed walking, bending and collecting items of equipment and loading their works vehicles, without too much sign of discomfort (it may be due to the amount of painkillers he had been given) but it is worthy to note, most fractures of ribs are usually extremely painful, when only breathing, let alone moving around, bending and picking things up. It is also worthy to note, the IP plays rugby as a hobby and D&B are trying to obtain evidence whether the IP had recently been involved in a friendly game or practice, although this should not be the case in light of the Coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak.    Update as of Monday 23rd March: It has been reported that the IP was diagnosed with bruised ribs and pulled muscles, there was suspicion of cracked/broken ribs because there was shadowing in the area. He was working on Saturday Night (21st) an is in work now, Monday 23rd March 2020. Immediate cause - The immediate culvert watercourse, embankment and bed area were strewn with copious debris, fly-tipping and drug paraphernalia. As the IP was returning from the GRP dam sheet pile installation works to the culvert headwall, he lost his footing, slipped and fell directly onto a now visible in-situ cast-iron pipe, crossing the watercourse bed, causing injury to his right side chest. Underlying cause - The access arrangements (ladder used yesterday but not available today) and working area were not correctly assessed and hazards mitigated. The area was overgrown and consisted of copious fly-tipping debris and vegetation which while some were removed by the site team, albeit in an ad-hoc manner the rest was left in place, causing further obstruction and remaining wet and slippery.  At least two members of the ARCH team hold the CITB Site Supervisor Safety Training Scheme competence and have worked in their industry for many years. As such they should have easily realised the hazards presented on first arrival on the site and subsequent observation of the culvert environment when the murky water levels receded. TQ's should have been forwarded accordingly at any stage of additional hazard identification and no works stopped until a safe satisfactory methodology was provided, to ensure safe access and working envirnoment at all times.  Remedial action - Before works recommence, re-assessment of the whole area, including access & egress throughout the work-site must be performed. Technical queries are to be forwarded to the client NR to ensure all fly-tipping and debris is removed safely and in line with waste management processes.

This caused the IP to fall 8 to 10 feet, landing on his back.   All works were stood down and witness statements taken.  His colleague had been given the task of clearing low level brash around the crest using hedge trimmers and to check for any ropes. The IP was taken to hospital to be checked out.   An update from Wigan Hospital revealed he was in a stable condition with a T12 fracture of his spine. He was immobile in bed and taking pain relief. Depending on the hospital's work load he was due to be transferred to Salford Hospital for further assessment later that night or the following morning. The early prognosis was that he would be released after assessment at Salford, fitted with a back brace. He would then be off work for at least 6 weeks for recovery. Initial investigation found that works were being undertaken for the Civils CAM programme to remove vegetation and descale the rock face on the embankment to the rear of Aughton Park Station. To complete these works J Murphy and Sons employed a specialist subcontractor Ropetech Access Solutions Limited to complete the works using roped access techniques. As works progressed one of the four operatives on ropes had an issue with his chainsaw while cutting a particular sapling down and returned to the van. The IP appears to have traversed across the slope towards this tree to complete the removal. In doing so he has dragged his own working and safety lines across the path of another operative who was working a higher level.  The operative at the higher level, not recognising that ropes were now in his working area,  cut down bushes with a hedge trimmer and cut the working and safety line of the IP. The IP then fell 10 to 12 feet onto the platform injuring his back in the process.

This was identified as a result of the anti-slip fabric having been worn away following increased foot fall as part of a renewals project being completed over the past few weeks. First aid treatment was not administered and hospital treatment was not required. No lost time. Immediate cause: the IP lost traction on the bottom step of the signal box stairs when leaving duty. Underlying cause: the anti-slip covering had become worn away from wear and tear and had not been noticed by users until the IP slipped. With works being carried out at the location (gates to barriers at Brigg LC) there had been an increase in footfall to/from Brigg signal box.  This was not identified as a risk and no check was made to ensure the fabric of the stairs was in the correct state to cope with this increase in footfall.  There was no check or inspection carried out of the stairs and the condition of the fabric of the stairs.

He was taken to Swindon hospital to get it checked out.  UPDATE The IP fractured his ankle. A temporary cast was fitted to his left ankle and he was told to go to a local hospital in the week for further exam. 21 days lost. Findings •	The lifting task, specific to the event, was planned and had been completed on a few occasions throughout the week. •	This specific lift was not well documented in task briefs (TB) or Works Package Plans (WPP) with only a reference being made within TB02, Sheet Piling Installation. The site have been given an action to create a specific TB for the lifting and moving of sheet piles that will improve the description of the lift  and to update the WPP to reflect the change. •	A lift plan is in place for the lift and has been signed off by the Appointed Person, MS, which is compliant with AmcoGiffen management systems procedure HS50. •	The three man team and the equipment used were competent for the duties of the lift. GPF is a trained slinger and the MO was trained to complete lifts with an excavator. The competencies are available within the report. •	The team consisted of a third person who’s duty was to tie the tag line to the sheet piles to assist in restricting movement whilst in transit to the sheet pile installation area. •	The area where the lift was being completed had not been cleared of hazards and was littered with lumps of hardened clay which ranged in size from a tennis ball to a football size and some of these lumps were within the path of the IP when moving clear prior to lift. •	The footwear being worn by the IP was in good condition, laced up and being worn correctly. Direct Cause Failure to recognise, report and remove a hazard within a work area. Indirect causes  •	IP completing the exit movement by walking backwards as opposed to turning and walking forwards. •	Lumps of hardened clay varying in size within the working area and in the pathway of IP •	Direction of exit for the IP to move clear of machine prior to lift Conclusion There has been a significant number of lifts completed to move the sheet piles from the area of storage to the workplace. All of those lifts had been from the same area where the event occurred. The hazard was in place for all the previous lifts and the failure to recognise the hazard, complete a close call or a Point of Work Risk Assessment will not have enabled the three man team to remove it and possibly avoid the event.",Level,Other: Bare earth,,"Amalgamated Construction Ltd., Network Rail",Infrastructure worker,,Other,Cause not established,0.125,Workforce (on-duty): Specified

First aid treatment was administered on site and the injured party (IP) attended Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) and was discharged at 05:55. The IP had concussion and a headache. Immediate cause: the Contractor slipped and lost their footing on wet wooden sleepers whilst trying to hold the sleeper up to assist in clipping up rail on Mill base plates  (MRC base plates).  Underlying cause: replacing rail with the MRC fastenings can be often difficult  especially on curved track due to the nature of their design.

This caused the climber to react to the experience and reach out to steady them-self.  The preliminary investigation believes a small adjustment made in body position of the climber was sufficient to cause the spike to slip out of the bark.  *The climbers spikes were new and in excellent condition. *The tree being worked on was an English Oak - the characteristics of this tree is to have hard wood and would limit the depth of the penetration of the spike Slack in primary climbing line - insufficient rope tension at the bridge of the climbing harness contributed to the climbers body dropping a small distance when the spike slipped out of the bark. (the preliminary investigation confirms the climber was also attached to a work positioning strop.    Climber confirmed during interview that there was some slack in primary climbing line but within recommended tolerance (no more than 500mm) that contributed to the climber dropping slightly from his work position as the spike slipped.

On the day of the accident at 14:00 the new PIC received the SWP (from the Mon-Wed PIC) and sent the pack over to COSS of the chainsaw group. The chainsaw group COSS swiped staff in at 21:00 and received the SWP from the PIC at 21:47. Staff then receive an insufficient brief from the COSS and they went on site at 22:20. 3 of the 4 groups have Peli lights however IP and the chainsaw operator were only using their headtorches to work. At 23:30 the IP  entered the 5m exclusion zone to clear and stack the cut branches.

The IP was then transported to hospital, arriving at the Queen Elizabeth at 23:05 and required 18 stitches to his right hand.  Exclusion zones: the IP entered the agreed 5m exclusion zone when a chainsaw was in use.  Plans and permits:With the COSS receiving the pack minutes before starting the job and giving an insufficient brief- Neither him or the chainsaw group would be sure the required plans and permits were in place. There were numerous 019 fall downs in the days leading up to the accident which meant the wrong PIC name was signing off the SWP as complete. Immediate cause:- IP falling onto the chainsaw with his right hand. Underlying cause:- IP entered the agreed 5 metre (chainsaw working)  exclusion zone Remedial action:- An exclusion zone brief shall be carried out to all NWR & QTS staff working on behalf of Glasgow MDU. The brief should entail  that tree felling is a one man operation and a minimum exclusion zone of 5m shall be kept at all times when the saw is in use.  WFHSA to explore the possibility of acquiring exclusion zone warning systems within NR.  Underlying cause:- The IP had insufficient lighting to carry out the work. Remedial action:- SM to undertake review of chainsaw operations at night- Are there enough Peli lights available every shift? Are there sufficient charging spaces for the lights? Staff are to be briefed that on no occasions should they carry out chainsaw activity using a head torch. 'Don't Get Left in the Dark' lighting and safety guide to be brief to all off-track and QTS staff. A formal review of the hierarchy  of working in darkness to be carried out by OTSM & TME. Underlying cause:- Underfoot conditions were extremely poor. Remedial action:- Review of factors effecting work being carried out in darkness. Item should be covered through the 'Don't Get Left in the Dark' lighting and safety guide. OTSM & TME to review opportunities for day shift working . Underlying cause:- The IP was working at a faster rate than the chainsaw operator - The IP had no cognition of the chainsaw operator and entered the agreed exclusion zone to move the branches to get the job complete faster. Remedial action:- All QTS/ NWR staff  that were on site to be briefed on the importance of good communication skills on site. Underlying cause:- Inexperienced COSS giving poor brief Remedial action:- COSS to revert to L2 competence for controller of site safety. He should formally undertake a robust development plan focusing on communication and on site guidance. TME to review COSS brief on site during plan.  Immediate cause:- Worksafe procedure was not invoked  by any members of staff after the poor COSS briefing given. Remedial action:- Staff to be re-briefed on the importance of feeling safe and comfortable to carry out specific work. All staff to be involved in the  accident improvement workshop.  Immediate cause:- Conflict between hierarchies on site- Not clear who is in charge of site safety on site/ where instructions are coming from.  Remedial action:- Off-Track SM to brief out to all NR and QTS staff working for off-track Glasgow MDU that the nominated COSS shall be in charge of all safety on site. Both NR and QTS staff to be involved in the accident improvement group.  QTS staff to report to Cowlairs at the start of every shift to untake pre work briefing to establish site roles.  Immediate cause:- Inexperienced COSS receiving the SWP at 21:47, 20 minutes prior to going into site. He has insufficient time to suitably review the worksite. Remedial action:- Rebrief to all off-track NWR staff on the 019 process. COSS and PIC on night of accident to be actively involved in briefing.  Immediate cause:- 2 instances of a same shift verification fall down. 1 on the Monday after work changed from Clydsdales to RCB line when packs were created on the Monday.  The responsible manager signed the Wednesday pack with the Monday same shift verification code. 2 instances of the fall down on the Thursday with the packs sent out on the night of the accident.  Remedial action:- 019 process to be re-briefed out. Self assurance checks to be carried out by an engineer from a different section. SM to review COSS competences and create a development plan to bridge the 019 knowledge gap.  Immediate cause:- Monday-Wednesday PIC had signed all packs (Monday-Thursday) on the Monday as complete Remedial action:- PIC to be re-briefed on 019 process- DU to carry out self assurance on SWP from another engineer out with TME West Highlands. PIC to be removed of his COSS duties  and follow a mentorship programme formalised through sentinel to regain competence.  Immediate cause:- 019 fall down on the Monday night between the PIC and the responsible manager when PIC informs responsible manager he will not be out on site on the Thursday. A new pack should have been created by the planner and the new PIC. Remedial action:- Full section has been re-briefed on 019 process.

Following the sleeper being replaced and whilst attempting to reinsert a pandrol, upon placing the panpuller in place on top of the pandrol and attempting to draw the pandrol in, the panpuller slipped causing the MOS to fall backwards. Upon trying to break the fall the MOS landed upon her wrist, landing on a nearby baseplate and ballast condition awkwardly, sustaining a suspect break to the right wrist.  The MOS was conveyed to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary where a fracture of the distal radius was confirmed at 04:30 with employee being discharged with a prescription of Co-Dydramol painkillers.  TSM also confirmed member of staff was released from hospital and right wrist in plaster and will be off duty for further notice. Immediate cause - Broken wrist from a fall that occurred following a panpuller slipping attempting to install pandrols. Underlying cause - The pandrol being inserted was a e1809 type pandrol. This was the Pandrol that was already installed prior to the sleeper being replaced. TWI3C008 notes that Pandrols should be replaced 'Like for like'.  Normal pandrols to be inserted in PAN baseplates are PR401A - this is due to the increased toe load leading to potential broken cast baseplates. There is a difference in toe load between both pandrols. Therefore, the wrong pandrol had been installed in the location prior to this shift.  Pandrol type e1809 nominal toe load per clip = 9kN Pandrol type PR401A nominal toe load per clip = 6.5kN Remedial actions - Independent inspections of all cast baseplates to identify where e1809 pandrols have been installed and replace to PR401A.  Safety discussion to all TME Perth track staff members to be undertaken within a safety hour format by the SM's to highlight the difference of Pandrols and the different type requirements within different site conditions. Underlying cause - MOS has been within the role for approx. 7 months which could overall still be seen as relatively inexperienced. MOS is still under PTS mentorship and a blue hat member of staff. It is noted though that the installation of Pandrols is a very common and regular activity and one the individual would be quickly familiar with.  Remedial actions - A buddy system for all blue hat members is regularly adopted as the norm within the SM Montrose section, however this should be reinforced. A dedicated safety hour to discuss the stance/posture required when installing pandrols should take place - noting within the buddy system importance of monitoring various techniques being adopted by staff members.  Underlying cause - The wear gauge to test the hook condition/wear of panpullars was purchased and delivered in brand new condition on 20th of May. All Panpullers in SM Montrose section were assessed by 29/05/2020 and deemed fit for purpose. NR recommended inspection regime is at least once every 6 months. There is no record of inspection upkeep currently with pan pullers not containing any unique identifier number.  Remedial actions - All panpullers in TME Perth to be given a unique identifier number. A record of all panpullers, date of wear test inspections being undertaken and inspection findings to be created and maintained through the frontline teams. Underlying cause - MOS is currently a blue hat employee and under mentorship for PTS. The MOS has attended a manual handling course. however has currently not attended Track Induction course. Previous attempt onto a course 20-24th April proved to be fully booked (subsequently cancelled due to COVID19). To cover lack of training for Track Induction, SM Montrose have a 'Buddy' system in place to augment any lack of training in light of not receiving any formal Track Induction training yet. Training of new starts can be received in bits and can take a considerable time to bring operatives up to speed with basic core competencies. Remedial actions - Track induction course to be arranged and attended by MOS involved in accident. Booked for 27/07/2020.

Shrewsbury DU PW staff twisted ankle on loose ballast ay Llangynllo,"A member of Llandrindod P-way twisted his left ankle on some loose ballast while putting a trolley onto the track at 19 miles 20 chains near Llangynllo. He finished  his shift with no issues but when he got up next morning his ankle was swollen and he was unable to put weight on it. He did not attend work. Level 1 report: The IP and another member of staff removed a link trolley from their pick up truck, and carried it a short distance to the track. The IP was walking backwards up the ballast shoulder while carrying the trolley and slipped on loose ballast and fell backwards and the trolley came to rest on his legs. The work activity that the team were undertaking was slewing the track at various locations at 12 miles 34 chains to 12 miles 40 chains, 12 miles 49 chains to 12 miles 55 chains and 19 miles 00 chains to 19 miles 20 chains.  It was at the last site that this injury happened. The team on site consisted of the PIC/COSS, one operative who was also acting as the PC and another operative (3 team members). The works were planned to be undertaken in line block with token, GZAC # 6757785. Due to IT failure at Llandrindod Wells, the printing and issue of the SSWOPS for these works was unable to be completed. The PIC/COSS for the team on site for the weekend instead completed RT9909/IRP to capture site, work hazard details and the briefing of the team. This was discussed/authorised with the SM due to the IT issue but this is not considered to be a contributory factor in this accident. The operative undertaking the PC duties completed the RT3181 Line Blockage Form, taking the line blockage at 06:03, authority number 311 from Pantyffynnon Signal Box.  The call back time to hand back was agreed as 12:30. The PC then gave the PIC/COSS permission at 06:05 to sign into the line blockage. The access point that the team used was at 19 miles 20 chains, so it was closest to the rail slew job from 19 miles 00 chains to 19 miles 20 chains. The access allows vehicular parking  with direct access to the track. The track is elevated from the main access ground level, the track level is approximately 1.25m higher than the access point ground level. 0.75m of steep sloping embankment with the track on top, the ballast shoulder being approx 0.5m height. The vehicle transporting the equipment for the job was a Ford Transit long bed pickup. The equipment being one type B trolley, slewing jacks, shovels, sighting boards. The vehicle was parked parallel to the track in the access point, at a distance of approximately 1m from the bottom of the embankment. The operative acting as PC released the ratchet straps securing the trolley and dragged the trolley nearly off the pick up, supporting it ready for the PIC/COSS to take hold of the suspended end. The PIC/COSS took hold of the end supported on the pick up and lifted to hold next to his body. He then walked backwards to the track and proceeded to walk backwards up the steep embankment, with the operative/PC pushing him up the embankment. It was at the transition from earth embankment to track ballast that the accident happened. The operative/PC stated that the PIC/COSS seemed to trip/topple side/backwards, landing on the ballast shoulder with the trolley coming to rest on top of his legs.  The trolley was pushed off his legs. He stated that the PIC/COSS said he had twisted his ankle and needed 5-10 minutes rest. This was taken and the PIC/COSS continued with the rest of the shift. The team pushed up to 19 miles 00 chains and worked back to the access point area. The PIC/COSS was undertaking technical duties of siting the individual track slews in, so was not involved in the manual activities of digging the track ballast and using the slewing jacks. When completed, the team off tracked down the embankment and loaded the equipment back onto the pick up. The Line Block was handed back at 11:59. Points to note: The original works planned for the shift had been completed at an earlier date, yet the team leader had failed to notify the section manager of the completion.  Instead, the section manager was notified of this late on the Friday before the shift was due. This lead to the section manager having to identify alternative works that would still utilize the booked / planned line blockages. The alternative works assigned to the team was to undertake the track slews at the locations identified above. Due to the IT failure the section manager instructed the team leader/PIC to complete and Incident Response Form to capture the details of the jobs being undertaken. No Location Risks or Task Risks and associated control were identified on the RT9909/IRP. No description of works completed. The accident happened at approximately 09:00 Sunday 21/6/20 but not reported until 07:44 Monday 22/6/20 by the individual.  This was when the IP tried to put his boots on and his ankle was swollen, tender and painful to move.  It was at this point that the IP reported the accident, he didn't feel that it was severe at the actual time of the accident as he was able to complete the works. There is an alternative access, a level crossing, more suited to on tracking trolleys at approximately 18 miles 61 chains, 1/2 mile from site. When questioned why they didn't use the alternative access point at level crossing, the team members stated that they didn't want to walk for 1/2 mile to get to the job, when this access point is right where the job is. The team also state that they regularly use this access as it is one of the better ones. When questioned why the site and tasks risks with controls had not been briefed, the team members said that they are briefed all the time on slips, trips and other hazards. These activities are also regularly completed and the methodology and associated risks were considered to be well understood. Immediate cause: Slip/Trip on ballast shoulder. Underlying cause: Walking backwards carrying the trolley, especially up a ballast shoulder. Remedial action: Re brief of manual handling of trolleys - manual handling training days with Pristine. Re-brief for the use of correct/suitable access points allowing level access to track when works involve manual handling of trolleys/heavy items. Underlying cause: Incorrect/unsuitable access point for on tracking/handling trolleys and equipment onto track. Remedial action: Better planning to identify more suited access point to afford level access for the on-track and off-track of trolleys. Underlying cause: Operative pushing IP up the embankment, incorrect manual handling technique and poor control of the lift.

At 13.45 hours the signaller at Littleport signal box booked on duty. No irregularities were reported during the shift and due to a couple of service cancellations it was a quieter than normal shift. It is a single crewed signal box where signaller is required to signal trains and operate the manual level crossing gates attached. At 20.51 hours the Signaller made their way from the signal box to the level crossing in order to operate it. The signaller tripped whilst using the authorised walking route. This walking route is used by both staff and public. They tripped and fell, grazing both hands and knees. The signaller fell forwards onto the continuation of the walking route. The Anglia Control Centre (AICC) was contacted by the signaller and an incident log (CCIL) was created, number 2149405. The on call Level 1 manager  saw the incident log but was not informed by control. The manager made contact with the signaller to check on their welfare, complete the relevant contact forms and ask what happened. The manager then informed the AICC of their actions. The details of this conversation are recorded on the Anglia Staff Accident Reporting Form dated 28 June 2020 at 20.51 hours. A Mobile Operations Manager (MOM) from Ely was sent to the site of the trip. On inspection, a raised concrete panel was discovered with approx. 1 inch trip hazard. Photographs of this were taken. The raised concrete is located in the 4 foot of the Down Kings Lynn line which is the closest line to the signal box. This was faulted to control, and close called by the Ely MOM, and was fixed the next day (29-06-2020) by members of the Ely Off track team.  The Signaller was wearing the correct safety boots which fitted well. They did not require any first aid treatment. The signaller completed their shift and returned as planned for their next shift. No absence from work has been recorded. No issues of fatigue have been identified. The area was lit by floodlight from the adjoining station as well as crossing specific floodlights. There is no CCTV at the location. The last planned general inspection (PGI) recorded was conducted in October 2019. No concerns to the walking route were reported. This location is part of the EACE (Ely Area Capacity Enhancement) project which will see the removal of the manual level crossing within approximately 18 - 24 months.

The IP was taken off site, no first aid was administered.  The IP went to A&E for assessment. Update from Level 1 Investigation: Activity for the shift was distributing ballast from box trailers using a road rail vehicle (RRV) following tamping to mitigate any CRT issues. This was a moving activity over a distance of approximately 1 mile 35 chain within a worksite under possession. Lighting was from a head torch and RRV lights. The injured person (IP) was walking in the 4 foot in front of the RRV. When returning with the RRV to the road rail access point (RRAP) on completion of works, the IP, who was undertaking the role of machine controller, stood on a piece of ballast causing him to misplace his foot. His foot went into a low track bed, resulting in him injuring his right foot. The IP was able to return to the RRAP and egress the RRV. The IP declined the offer of first aid and hospital treatment as he did not realise the severity of the injury and thought that he could walk it off. Following this he drove himself home and went to bed. When he woke his foot was stiff and painful. He attended his local accident and emergency department at Sandwell General Hospital. His foot was x-rayed and diagnosed as having a hairline fracture near the top of the fifth toe (small toe) on his right foot, he was advised to wear a surgical boot for the next 4 weeks. This was still to be evidenced, the IP had stated that confirmation was being posted to him from the hospital. This event was classed as a lost time injury - 8 days. This and other RRV activities in the area were assessed for suitability of using a dispatch and receive method of moving RRVs between locations. Whilst this was deemed appropriate for some activities it was not suitable for this one as the RRV was unloading at several locations, short distances apart, during the course of the shift. This location was being worked in over 2 midweek night shifts, covering a distance of approximately 1.5 miles. Lighting was provided by a head torch and the RRV lights. Providing link lighting was deemed unpractical and would have imported additional risk to those installing and dismantling it, portable task lighting was available to illuminate work areas but this was too heavy and cumbersome to use for moving activities Due to Mill Road access, which was close to the work area, no longer being available, there was now a 6 mile gap in access points around this area. This increased the distance walked by the IP. Immediate Cause IP misplaced his foot when walking on ballast. Underlying Causes The track bed between the sleepers where the IP was walking had a low level of ballast resulting in the IP injuring his foot when it entered the track bed. Remedial Actions Work areas to be surveyed and low track beds identified, filled in and compacted to provide a more stable walking route.

The bar slipped off the top of the railhead causing the IP to fall, catching his left shin on the top of the rail and causing some grazing and bruising.  No first aid was given on site.  Full PPE was being worn at the time of the incident. Swindon P/Way were moving rails utilising both turning bars and standard bars from the sleeper ends in preparation of a tamping shift. There were 18 staff deployed to deliver the work in line blockages. Whilst moving one rail circa 100 foot long, the Injured Person (IP) was using a turning bar, from the four foot pushing the rail from the cess side sleeper end into the cess, which slipped off the top of the railhead causing them to fall and catch his left-hand shin on the top of the rail. Immediate cause - The turning bar slipped off the top of the railhead causing the IP to fall, catching his left-hand shin on the top of the rail. Underlying cause -The team were equipped with the tools required for the tasks, as some rails had to be rolled over and others needed to remain upright. At the time of the incident, the team were utilising two types of bars simultaneously. A turning bar to roll the rail over and a standard bar that would move a rail whilst keeping it upright. By using both simultaneously, neither process would operate as designed. Remedial action - Consult TWI 2P004 – How to turn rail upright & TWI 2G046 – How to move rail manually.  Rail Turning Bar, Ratchet (Cat No 0039/001005) will assist when rail at awkward angles. If a 36m (120ft) rail is to be turned, at least 3 persons are needed with one holding one end of the rail with a turning bar.

An Ambulance was called to site. Person was up and moving around after the fall. They were treated first aid. They were taken to hospital where they had an x-ray carried, with nothing untoward found. The individual was expected back in work the following morning. The individual returned to work the following day.   Risk ranking: M/J - Low risk: Operative error not clipping on would cause injury to themselves.  Not working to SG4 would is a single operative error and would only cause single fatality of that given person. There is a low chance of this happening.  The risk being low given that when operatives are working within the standards it is a very low chance and operative can fall from height.   The low count as evident that in 25 years of operations QED Scaffolding have never had a scaffolder falling from height whilst erecting scaffold until this occasion. Fair culture classification: Was the action deliberate: Yes                                                Was the action well intentioned? Yes                                                Informed about procedures? Yes                                                Procedures clear & workable? Yes Outcome:                             Contravention. Investigation:                       No further investigation required. Immediate cause: Scaffolder was not working on a in accordance with industry guidance SG4:15 and TG5: 18. Underlying cause:  Individual is a highly qualified and highly experienced scaffolder.  Individual had many years’ service, working on high profile jobs on and around the rail network.  Individual had just completed a high-profile job.    Individual's experience on larger jobs had caused him to come complacent on a job which appeared to him to be low risk and mediocre. Due to the relative low height and simplicity of the task Individual appears to have shown complacency and worked to the standards set out and expected of all scaffolders.    The evidence shows that the scaffold at the base was not installed correctly although structurally sound it was evident that the base scaffold was not properly supported.  See images in appendix. Remedial actions: Individual has been re-briefed in the statuary guidance of installing scaffolding safely (SG4). Individual was given this as a toolbox talk the morning after the incident when he reported to work.  Individual showed good knowledge of the standard.    In order to ensure Individual works to these standards on all projects Individual must upload pictures via our internal APP at each stage of erecting scaffolding.  Before ""signing"" into work via the APP Individual is to confirm that all his PPE is in order been checked and that all works can be carried out safely to the statutory guidance.  Individual was also tasked with giving the toolbox talk to our other operatives as a lesson’s learned. These have been completed and Individual has in part spoke to operatives within the company, however not all operatives have been briefed at the time this report was written.  The APP was introduced on 16/07/2020, partially to the company wholly to Individual.  Underlying cause: When working on the scaffold boards to erect the scaffold the spacings and method of supporting boards was not per best practice or indicated on the side of the band on the scaffold board.  As the scaffold board was not supported in enough places this added to the strain of timber when the operative walked out on the board making the board snap. Remedial actions: All scaffold boards to be checked to ensure that the banding states that the board has the correct support spacing.  Operatives all to be re-briefed on the structural spacing of the board and how this can be identified.   A full re-brief to the company to be given in line with a toolbox talk to all operatives and to be logged and held on both the health and safety and personnel files of all operatives. Underlying cause: Scaffold board failed snapping causing the fall of the scaffolder. Remedial actions: Although we cannot tell if the board was supported correctly that it would have failed or not it is clear that the board has snapped and failed.  All scaffold boards on existing jobs were checked either that evening, or the following day prioritizing works over track, on the infrastructure and deemed high risk.  A standard scaffold inspection report was carried out and scanned in (see appendix for example)  Scaffold yard operatives were briefed on checking boards and all boards hire and non-hire were checked quarantined as per our normal practice.",Level,Timber,,"Network Rail, Other, CrossCountry",Infrastructure worker,Duties to maintain track or infrastructure,"Error or violation; Infrastructure, vehicles, equipment and clothing",Equipment fault; Failing to see or notice hazard,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

The incident wasn't reported to Network Rail Control at the time. AmcoGiffen were contracted to clean out the guttering and downpipes which are located just above the tunnel crown at the base of the air shafts. These are choked with spalled brickwork residue, AmcoGiffen were also contracted to ensure the drainage system was fully operational post cleaning and repair any defective sections as required. The preferred method of accessing this section is by way of a Mobile Elevated Working Platform (MEWP). During the shift while the basket was extended, the MEWP's fail-safe activated and required to be re-started from the auxiliary control panel on the side of the vehicle, this was unexpected as the MEWP was working well within its limits but is not unheard off. The triggers or sensors on these type of vehicles could be considered as sensitive but are designed so as to reduce any strains on the vehicle limits.  The Operative lowered the basket and exited to access the auxiliary control panel, restarted the MEWP then stepped back to return to basket. While stepping back the Operative stepped onto a catch pit lid which moved and the Operative's leg fell through and the Operative landed on the ballast with his leg in the catch pit. (Immediate Cause) The COSS / Site Supervisor checked on the Operative assisting him up. The Operative made assurances he was OK and fit to continue his duties for the remainder of the shift. The Site Supervisor contacted AmcoGiffen On-Call Manager at the end of the shift advising him of the incident along with a general report of the completed works. The On-Call Manager noted the incident, it was raised as a close call, entered into the AmcoGiffen accident book and shared out through the weekend reporting email. Network Rail Control wasn't informed until the 23rd of July. Upon inspection of the catch pit lids it was discovered that these were of mixed construction, using newer GRP collars and the existing concrete lids which weren't able to be secured in place. (Underlying Cause) It appears that the catch pits in the area may have been in the process of being renewed, there was a pile of lids and collars near the access point. it was also noted that a number of catch pits had concrete collars with new GRP lids, again unable to have been secured. Further investigation into the site documentation revealed that AmcoGiffen had only identified issues from the access point to the tunnel portal as no safe access was available. NR Works Delivery is intending to work with AmcoGiffen to provide guidance on producing a bespoke hazard map for each worksite paying particular attention to sites where no safe access is available, tunnels, cuttings, viaducts etc. Immediate cause - Stepped backwards onto unsecured catch pit lid Underlying cause - Catch pits were constructed using a mix of materials Remedial actions - Catch pits need to be constructed correctly Underlying cause - SWP Hazard Map did not identify the risk of the catch pits. Remedial actions - Bespoke Hazard Map to be completed prior to works, this may involve an additional possession shift due to working in areas not visible from a position of safety.

Cardiff DU PW staff fell and bruised back when a handrail gave way at Penycoed underbridge near St Clears LC,"A member of Whitland permanent way staff was working at Pen-y-coed underbridge at 253 miles 57 chains. He leant on a handrail and it give way. He fell over and hurt his back. He was escorted to hospital for a check up. Fault 471568 raised for the access point hand rail to be repaired. Level 1 report: A team of Whitland P-way were waiting at Pen-Y-Coed access point following handing back a line blockage for lifting and packing twist faults, the team were waiting at the access point until they could retake the line blockage. The IP was sitting on the hand rail which gave way under their weight. This resulted in one person falling backwards with a drop of 1.5m resulting in a back injury, cuts and bruise. IP has been taken to A&E to check for internal injuries. The incident was reported to the section supervisor at 12:12 and Control at informed at 12:18 by the section supervisor. Immediate cause: IP sat on wooden hand rail of access steps which gave way under their weight. This caused the IP to fall backwards from a height of 1.5m onto uneven ground which was a mixture of vegetation and ballast. Underlying causes: Behavioural issues - The IP should have been challenged by his colleagues when carrying out the mounting process of the handrail. The handrail was not braced and was only secured by a diagonal screw - several other sections of the same access point had no bracing, and were similarly secured. There was also concerns after 'Go ,look,see' around the construction of the access point with untreated softwood. The design of the access point was not to standard relating to forces, designated in the construction standard. There had been no formal handback of this access point from works delivery. The access point was a substantial upgrade on the previous access point at this location and even though the access point may not have been to a specific design, the access point was suitable for purpose. There were tripping hazards on this access where the steps / risers were not secured properly and the step edges were bulging causing trip hazards. Although not related directly to this incident, there was a spillage of chippings on the bottom steps which would also have provided a slip / trip hazard. These could easily have been removed whilst waiting for a line blockage ( Behavioural Cause) Light vegetation had recently been cut back under off track maintenance at this location, however due to the weather conditions over the last few weeks this has grown rapidly and was encroaching on some steps, even from the banking below. This access point was typical of a quick fix around the previously dilapidated access point and was done for the right reasons with minimal cost. We may have several others like this on the DU and this is currently being followed up by WHSEA. First aid arrangements - due to the seriousness of the IP's injuries it might have been better to immobilize him and called for the ambulance rather than rely on the IP's insistence that he was ok ,and could walk to the van. Remedial actions: A Safety alert to be issued around the behaviours / response and subsequent findings relating to this accident - Issued 28/07/2020 WHSEA to liaise with Works Delivery WHSEA to determine the possible number of similar sites across the DU.-28/08/2020 Works delivery now have a person in place to manage the AMP process for them.

The IP had been retrieving paper work when they tripped on the ballast which had been dug out, the IP put their hands out to break their fall causing the injury. First aid was applied and the IP then drove themselves to hospital as the cut was quite deep. NR2072P: A Technical Officer (TO) working on behalf of the Wimbledon Assistant Track Maintenance Engineer (ATME) was covering the level 3 stress on 723 points at Wimbledon. The stress on 723 points was to take place between the A and B end crossover and the TO was tasked with carrying out the measurements required in relation to this stress. As the TO was walking between the stress limits, he tripped on a sleeper edge of a partially filled bay and fell. While falling, the TO put his hands out to break his fall and cut his left hand and had also suffered swelling to his right hand. Fortunately, the swelling suffered to the right hand reduced quickly. The cut on his left hand was cleaned, inspected and bandaged up on site by the nominated first aider and the TO was advised to attend hospital to have the cut flushed and possibly stitched, this was due to the depth of the laceration suffered. The TO left site and was to provide an update once he had attended hospital. The TO had his hand further cleaned and re-bandaged and stitches were not in fact required.

(IRIS 3233),"At 10:00 IP (injured party) was inspecting layout at Harworth, IP was standing on concrete bearers and tripped as they stepped down and twisted their right ankle. The individual was walking on an S&C Layout undertaking an inspection as part of their normal activities. They then stepped off the layout walking towards their van to return their tools and lost footing causing them to fall over and twist their ankle.  There was a rock (approx. 10cm) on the ground in the area that the individual believed they may have stepped on causing them to go over. Near to this incident there was a bearer with a piece of re-bar (steel pole) with string wrapped around it sticking straight up (like a spike). The individual missed falling onto the spike, by approximately 30-40cm. The individual had not stepped straight off the bearer but at an angle to where the vehicle was parked. There was initial pain, the individual sat in their van waiting for the pain to subside. They then called their line manager who advised them to report it to the site manager and see a first aider. Upon attending the first aider, the pain had reduced but was still there, Ice pack applied. The incident was reported to the Site manager who arranged for the first aider, the site manager also immediately removed the spike and initiated further internal investigations as this was not normal practice. The string was usually wrapped around a piece of 4x4 wood. Immediate cause:  Cause of the accident can be put down to several factors: 1) Complacency; the individual carries out these tasks daily and was confident with walking on the bearers i.e. working at low height.  On this occasion, the individual misplaced their footing causing them to fall. 2) Uneven ground; the area in question was not a commonly used area, the site was very good at removing debris, however on this occasion although dry on the day was after some significant rainfall that caused some stones to be washed into the area. 3) Incorrect process for securing line. Immediate underlying issues addressed were, the removal of the re bar spike for securing line and individual awareness through briefing at the supplier. Underlying cause:  Root cause was difficult establish, but the fall had been put down to complacency, as the individual stepped sidewards off the layout and not forward in the direction of travel. The re bar was the primary focus of the investigation with the supplier, as this had the most potential to cause harm to the person. The use of re bar, or any protruding object had been prohibited.  Incident factor: Processes and procedure documents The person's environment Fatigue, health and Wellbeing Comments The potential to cause harm - Site procedure was to use a wooden block to wind the string line, this had not happened in this case as a re bar had been used lapse in concentration which caused the individual not to walk off the layout straight but in an angled direction Site was usually kept tidy with rocks/rubble cleared away on a regular basis - this area isn't commonly used and although dry on the day of the incident had previous had significant volumes of rainfall causing a few rocks/debris to gather in the location. Recommendations: VAE to remove the re bar string line and replace with wooden block as per their internal procedures - done VAE to re-brief internal staff on processes regarding sharp objects within the yard.

Track access had been arrange for WSP through their safety critical supplier, SWGR, to access the infrastructure at Calton North Tunnel.  The purpose of this shift was to carry out asbestos surveys to various assets to establish the presence of asbestos or otherwise. The team on the night was made up of 1 No. WSP Surveyor, 1 No. PIC (SWGR).  The WSP surveyor is experienced in accessing the track and holds a current PTS competency. All members of the team were wearing appropriate PPE and the injured party has confirmed that they were wearing appropriate footwear (type of boot). SWGR prepared the SWP for the works and WSP prepare the task briefing sheet for the works. Site specific risks were included in the TBS and a risk assessments was carried ahead of the work taking place.  Risk of walking on the track ballast was identified in this risk assessment and the surveyor was briefed on how to walk on the track.     On completion of the planned works at around 04:12hrs, the team were returning to the access point to exit the track.  The IP was walking away from the track and as they stepped over a concrete trough at the side of the track onto loose ballast, their supporting foot slipped and the IP fell forwards onto their hands and knees.  The accompanying COSS assisted the IP back onto their feet and the team continued to make their way off the infrastructure.  The IP initially thought that they had suffered a minor sprain and did not attend hospital immediately after.   The PIC on site provided assistance to the IP and helped them to their vehicle.  The incident was not reported to Control immediately on happening and was instead reported as a close call to their line manager. The IP drove home and went to bed approximately an hour after arriving home.  On waking the next day, the IP was sufficiently concerned about their ankle to seek medical assistance and they attended their local A&E Department.  An x-ray was taken and a minor ankle fracture diagnosed and the IP now has a medical boot to wear when weight bearing on her leg and has been given exercises to carry out to strengthen the ankle.  The IP has been placed on restricted duties for 6 weeks.  It was noted that the consultant who carried out the review of the IP's x-rays stated that they could not confirm that the fracture was an entirely new fracture due to the IP having had issued with their ankle in the past. WSP confirmed that this would be reported as a RIDDOR (over 7 day injury) in line with their obligations and, although the IP has been able to return to work, this will be reported as a lost time injury due to the fact that the IP has not yet been able to return to their full normal duties. Immediate cause: IP slipped and fell causing a fracture to their ankle. Underlying cause:- Unstable / loose ground surface. Remedial action:- Check that IP has been briefed by WSP to ensure that they exercise further caution when working at night and walking over loose ballast, ensuring that they are looking down when walking on uneven surfaces. Underlying cause:- Although not a cause of the accident, it has been identified that the contractor failed to report the accident to Network Rail Control at the time.

An ambulance was called an went on site.   IP slipped on some dust on the sleeper end.  IP attended hospital and suffered a sprained left knee, IP rested her knee at home. During the stressing of site the injured IP was stood in the 4ft clipping up the fast clips that were left around the welds, whilst doing this the IP was having a little difficulty in pulling in the clip with the fast clip inserter, they then placed their foot on the head of the inserter and applied more pressure whilst trying to pull the clip in.  Then for some unknown reason the hook of the inserter came loose which then caused the IP to fall backwards. As the IP fell they still had their right foot on the inserter which then put all of their weight onto their left leg, The IP then tried to balance themselves out by moving their left leg which then slipped and caused their Knee to pop out and fall over,  the IP then noticed their Knee was out of place which they then pushed it back in and shouted out with the pain, the Network Rail first aider then came over administrated first aid and then called the ambulance as the Injured IP could not be moved due to the pain. Immediate cause: Resistance on fast clip was more than standard resistance. Underlying cause: Grinding dust from welding penetrated into the Fast Clip which then made the Fast clip harder to insert.  Uneven ground conditions due to the ballast bay not being full after welding. Plus, grinding dust on the sleepers. Remedial actions:  WDM to brief staff on correct procedure. Fast clip should have been cleaned off before installation to make sure there was no grinding dust preventing the clip going in, the ballast bed should have also been filled to make the ground conditions even.

The troughing lid collapsed / flipped as the IP stepped on top, causing the IP to lose their footing and fall. The IP made contact with the edge of a Vortox fence pole positioned adjacent to the trough route as they fell and sustained a cut injury below their left eye. First aid was administered on site by the PIC appointed to the workgroup. The IP was further escorted to the local accident and emergency facilities at Hillingdon hospital. The IP was later transferred to Wexham Park hospital where a continuous stitch and dressing was applied to the wound. Immediate cause - The IP lost their footing and subsequently fell when a TroTred trough lid became dislodged when stepped on. Underlying cause - The IP was carrying two powered saws and a spirit level, which required both hands to be occupied. As a result, the IP was unable to effectively control their fall. The wheelbarrow could not be utilised to transport the tools for the full extent of their journey towards the site of work due to a HV trough route intersecting with the walkway presenting an obstacle. By design the Vortox barrier tubes are not capped off and present a rough edge. Exposed trackside cabling between OLE Spider Plate and trough lid could have contributed to the fall or the lid not sitting securely. The workgroup signed in with the site access controller over the phone instead of face to face as required. This resulted in the SAC’s independent PPE checks being conducted to ensure full PPE was being won prior to sign in and PPE was of a good condition. Included in this check are glasses checks and book checks to ensure they are laced up correctly and of suitable condition. The workgroup PIC identified slippery underfoot condition due to the morning dew. Root cause - The TroTred trough route walkway had only recently been installed and the work activity for the whole section was still in progress.

Level 1 report: Whilst unloading a Robel grinder from off a RRV trailer in the Severn Tunnel, a welder tripped/fell backward over a rucksack that had been placed behind him without his knowledge. As a result of the fall he injured his left elbow as he put his arm out to stop the fall. Immediate cause: A welder fell over a bag that was placed behind him, without his knowledge, as he was removing a rail grinder off a RRV trailer. Underlying cause: Two RRVs with trailers transported the welders and Per Way men plus all the combined plant & equipment including 2 rails into the Severn Tunnel from the Welsh end. The two RRVs stopped on site opposite each other and the welders/Per-Way proceeded to unload their plant/equipment into the 10 foot area between the RRV trailers. The 10 foot area was very narrow and confined with an estimated twenty men unloading plant/equipment into this area it was very congested.  This congestion led to the bag being placed where the welder tripped over it. The job was also running late due to late occupation so there was limited time to complete the rail change and also recover scrap rail from the tunnel using the RRVs. Remedial action: The regular late occupations due to isolation issues need to be sorted out so sufficient time is allowed to complete all the jobs.  The work site should have been organized better (staggered) so that the tools & equipment could be unloaded into the 10 foot whilst allowing enough space for the men to work and and place the equipment down safely.

This occurred whilst on shift with the WDT Arbroath team in Stonehaven station on their planned re-sleepering job at 11a+b Pts. The Member of staff along with three other colleagues maneuvered a 2.7m bearer. After it was positioned under the rails the Injured Person(IP) noticed the bearer required a little adjustment to the right to centre it. The IP straddled the bearer and was facing the down cess from his position in the 6ft. The IP set the tongs over the end of bearer ,tensed by applying pressure on the tongs in an upward and outward direction. The IP believed the tongs to be set and secure and proceeded to slew to his right. The tongs slipped and caused the IP to fall away from the bearer and landed on the ballast in the six foot, striking his left arm on the rail on the opposite line.  This all happened very quickly and initially the IP believed they were fine . A little time passed approx 10 mins and the IP observed the extent of the swelling on the left wrist/arm area and started to experience a little more pain. The IP reported this to the PIC who in turn advised the First Aider who administered a bandage and advised them to elevate their left arm. The IP did not continue their duties , and was taken off site and driven down to the depot in Perth by a colleague. The IP attended their local hospital in Dunfermline where he was x-rayed and no fracture was detected. The IP had full PPE on during the accident.

The Lookout, who is a trained first aider, suffered minimal discomfort to his left ankle and treated the ‘injury’ himself. The Lookout then close called the vegetation but did not report the accident, as he did not believe it to be necessary.  The accident was raised to the responsible Delivery Unit (DU), Wessex Inner, by the Safety, Health and Environmental Assistant (Wessex) when it was brought to his attention by his colleagues in the Sussex Route. Initial discussions were held between the Lookout and his Section Supervisor to ascertain his condition. The Lookout reported that his ankle felt fine and despite a previous incident with the same ankle, he was fit to return to work for his next shift and all shifts thereafter. There was no lost time attached to the accident and the Lookout returned for his next shift. Immediate cause: The Lookout's foot was caught in overgrown vegetation.

IRIS3826,"During a preparatory shift for a forthcoming track renewal, 2x RRVs and their trailers were being on-tracked at Innerwick Feeder Station plant access point prior to transporting materials including short rails and geotextile rolls to site. Having on-tracked and completed loading its trailers, the first RRV moved clear of the RRAP to allow the second RRV to on-track. The Machine Controller (MC), who was stood by the access gate, stepped back to let this machine through, and in doing so fell backwards into a partially open manhole which the staff were unaware of, and the lid of which had at some point become displaced. The MC reported pain in his ankle, and despite colleagues offering to summon an ambulance, chose to drive himself to the accident and emergency department at the hospital local to his home. It was later confirmed that he had fractured his ankle.  The manhole is approximately 2 foot square and of unknown depth/ purpose. The chamber walls appear to be cast concrete, while the lid and its associated frame are steel. The lid and frame are not fixed to the concrete however, despite the frame being provided with holes for holding- down bolts, so there is nothing physically securing the lid and frame in place. While not buried, the manhole lid is flush with the ground and covered with a thin layer of type 1 stone (see photos). It is located about a foot in front of the left- hand gate post at the access point.  It is entirely possible that a RRV, or the materials it was moving, may have caught and shifted the lid and its frame shortly before the accident, as some of the geotextile rolls had been delivered next to the fence to the left of the access gates. However, the staff on site cannot confirm this was the case, so it's equally possible the manhole was already in this condition when they arrived.

The IP had been walking on ballast when they misplaced their footing causing them to catch it on a sleeper resulting in them rolling the ankle and then falling over.  The IP carried on working but was clearly in pain. IRIS: The Injured Person (IP) was acting as Controller of Site Safety (COSS) for an crossing arc repair on 2113b No2 crossing at Hampton Court junction. The site of work was illuminated with a double headed tower-light and in addition each team member was wearing a headlight. The IP was assisting the welder to unload small plant and hand tools from the trolley when he stepped over the crossing to adjust tools the load. the area of ballast where he was stepping was not adequately covered by the site lighting and was distorted by shadow. As a result he misjudged his movement causing him to roll/twist his ankle on the edge of a concrete bearer and a low ballast bed. The IP carried on with his duties only noticing discomfort when moving around to clear the site when the repair was completed. The IP finished his shift and applied ice to his ankle when he got home. He attended his next shift. Conclusion Although the Person In Charge (PIC) has overall accountability in setting up a safe site, including lighting,  at night it is unfair to expect them to be able to be able to achieve the brightness that would be found during daylight hours. The team had adequate lighting and it is reasonable to expect individuals to adjust this as and when their needs require it. Immediate cause: IP stepped over crossing and rolled his ankle. Underlying cause: Poor lighting resulted in distorting the underfoot conditions leading the IP to misjudge where he was standing. Risk ranking: Low Risk  L/H L / H Hazards potentially causing slips trips and falls are present on the railway infrastructure.

Update: the IP was released from hospital. Only swelling and bruising. was sustained. The IP was accompanied back to the depot and was able to drive themselves home. If the swelling went down overnight, the IP was expected at work the following day. Immediate cause: Working environment conditions, the fact that the cess area and the ballast were not maintained to create a safe working area for any working staff. Possibility that IP could have over stretched to reach a little further leaving him off balance, as well as the loose, wet ballast and vegetation. Underlying cause: The work activity planned by the OT SM placed IP in the cess, a genuinely poorly maintained area to work in. The vegetation been cleared was a section clearance - in order to complete a section clearance all low level vegetation was cleared as well as woody vegetation - with forward thinking this low level brush clearance could have been left reducing the time Member of staff were spending in the cess area. Remedial actions: SM and SS would continue to discuss all vegetation works at the planning stage with PIC/TL, low level brush clearance on and in the cess area with a loose ballast shoulder or slope would be left and only completed when the ground in level and footing was good. This would reduce the risk of a repeat incident be removing staff members from the higher risk location for a Slip Trip Fall incident due to underfoot conditions.

The IP was fitting tie bars to brackets when they tripped on a bracket causing them to stumble. The IP landed awkwardly with all their weight landing on to their right ankle. Ice was applied to the injury. IRIS: On Sunday the 18th of October 2020, the Injured Person (IP), a contract worker from Four Tees Engineering working on behalf of the Feltham Track Maintenance Engineer (TME), was walking in the 4 foot of the Richmond River Bridge, carrying out work fitting tie bars to brackets, when they tripped on a 'J' bar bracket causing them to stumble and then land awkwardly, with all of his body weight going onto his right ankle.  The ankle was reported as being swollen and bruised however, the IP declined to go to hospital at the time of the event and instead had the injury treated with a bag of ice, which was applied to the swelling and approximately half an hour after the application had reduced the swelling enough so that the IP could later drive himself home to Reading. The IP later visited his local hospital, as the pain had not subsided and he was informed that he had suffered an ankle sprain. The IP had three days off of work as a result of the accident. The ‘team’ undertaking the works were Four - Tees Engineering (FTE) (who specialise in bridge repair and strengthening) working under Dyer and Butler. The team were working under the direct supervision of a Network Rail Controller Of Site Safety/Person In Charge (COSS/PIC) provided by Feltham P-Way as the NR site representative and their own Supervisor on site who had the necessary task experience for the work being carried out. The work to be undertaken consisted of remedial strap mechanism repairs, following previous works on this bridge that, following wheel timber installation, had caused track circuit failures and had resulted in the need to cut a number of tie bars/straps from their brackets. The COSS had briefed the team and signed them in prior to accessing the track at approximately 09:00. Shortly after starting the work, the injured person (IP) walked up the stairs and onto Richmond River Bridge (Bridge and Stairs shown in the attachments). At approximately 09:30, the injured person stepped from the cess and directly onto a ‘J’ bar (picture within the attachments) that was situated within the four foot of the bridge. The injured person fell to his knees and suffered almost immediate swelling to the right ankle and his Supervisor took him to a local Tesco where a bag of ice was purchased and applied to the injury. The Supervisor and the injured person were away from site for about one hour.  The swelling was reported to have reduced after approximately half an hour of treatment and the injured person rested the injury before driving to his home in Reading.  The Four Tees Supervisor agreed to report the accident, make phone calls to the Wessex Integrated Control Centre (WICC) etc so that the NR COSS didn’t have to stop the work and get everyone off track. The NR COSS did not report it to the ODM or complete a shift report because he was under the assumption that the incident had been reported by the Dyer & Butler supervisor and that his only responsibility was to COSS the job and to act as a representative for NR.

The IP (Injured Person) slipped on the Pontoon. The IP fell against the scaffolding, while his left leg got caught on the pontoon, this action caused his leg to be jarred in an unnatural position.  The IP completed work at Dovey Junction. He was called on 30/10/2020 at 1020 to obtain more details. The IP reported that he had seen a specialist and the specialist had told the IP it was a grade 2 ligament tear. Level 1 report: Whilst working on the pontoon the IP was knocking a wooden pile with a sledge hammer to realign the pile with the wailing. During the activity the IPs right foot slipped on the pontoon, this resulted in the IP loosing balance and falling towards the lower scaffolding support tower. The IPs right leg slipped into the water, the left knee taking the strain which sustained the injury (the IP was in a crouched kneeling in an unnatural position following slip). The EDS shift supervisor assisted the IP back onto the pontoon and was transported back to the welfare unit by the site boat. The IPs dry suit was removed and the strained leg elevated his leg to control the pain and discomfort. The IP suffered and ligament tear which resulted in 6 days lost time.   Note: The Employer (EDS) has confirmed the IP has returned to work on normal duties although receiving physio to aid a full recovery. Immediate cause: The IP slipped and lost his footing whilst knocking a wooden pile with a sledge hammer to realign the pile with the wailing. Underlying cause: The weather conditions were poor, heavy rain and high winds were continuous throughout the day causing slippery underfoot conditions.  The IP was unable to maintain a stable centre of gravity whilst using the sledge hammer this was due to a scaffold obstruction, the scaffold was erected around the trestle and extending through the piles. In an attempt to avoid the obstructing scaffold the IP positioned himself at an awkward angle in relation to the pile, this alteration to his centre of gravity under the wet, windy conditions caused him to slip on the wet pontoon. The pontoon surface was not treated with anti-slip. Remedial action: The IP and Site Management / Supervision should have undertaken a dynamic risk assessment of the working environment prior to authorising the activity to commence.  1. The adverse weather conditions increased the risk of a slip, trip or fall. 2. The scaffolding was erected around the trestle and extending through the piles were causing an obstruction thus creating an unsafe condition.

Shrewsbury DU welder slipped on the track at Conwy,"Whilst pushing a grinder along the track at Conwy station a welder lost his footing, slipped, bumped his knee and twisted his ankle. He returned home to rest the injury and would attend A&E later if there was further aggravation. No First Aid required. Not expected to be a lost time accident. Level 1 report: Conwy 31/10/2020 01/11/2020 Week 31 - NW 3001 Item 272 possession time from 2350 to 0820 The work planned for the 31/10/2020 was a projects/MDR re rail approximately 700 yards of track which required Thermit welding.  The worksite mileages were 224 miles 15 chains to 239 miles 5 chains.  The access point identified and used was Conwy station at 224 miles 38 chains.  The IP was working with the Llandudno Pway whom were undertaking the works on behalf of MDR and his usual welding partner as support. The welders were on site to assist in cutting the existing rail into manageable lengths that could be safely removed from site by the TRT's, then to Thermit weld up and profile grind the welds. Following the initial 4 flame cuts of the rail, the welders were then waiting around until needed again to drop the welds for the new rail.  This meant that they were waiting for approximately 3 hours. The accident occurred when the IP was pushing the Robel grinder on site, the weather at the time was cold with a frost forming on the ground and sleepers. Having spoken to the IP, he has said that his foot gave way and he fell, twisting his ankle and banged his knee on impact. There were strings of CWR in the four foot, which posed a hazard to walking, these were identified in the COSS SSOWP and briefed to all on site. It was believed that whilst he was pushing the Robel grinder, he unwittingly stepped on the timber sleeper and that was how the accident occurred. The IP was walking in the four foot whilst pushing the grinder, the grinder had a stabilizer bar and wheel attached. It was unclear what distance the IP walked to the site of work from the access point however, from discussions with PTO involved in the job, it was believed that the IP walked approximately 800 yards to the extremity then the accident occurred on the return to grind out and blend the new rail into the old profile. The Welding boots worn by the IP were in good condition with good tread and showing no signs of deterioration to their form. The boots worn were a pull on fire fighter type with internal elastic support, which meet the requirements of EN 15090:2012 F2A HI3 CI SRC. The IP was wearing a personal head-torch to illuminate his walking route.  The works that had been planned that night had not gone as expected, the lining up of welds had failed, sleepers were splitting and the rail was prevented from being adjusted to allow for accurate rail alignment required to undertake compliant welds. The works were planned to start at 2350, with only the rail cuts achieved and no welding progress had been made by 0530, so it was a reasoned assumption that the IP was feeling both tired and frustrated at the lack of progress and this may have led to him becoming distracted and not being as vigilant to his surroundings. Immediate cause: Pushing Robel hybrid rail head profile grinding machine, walking in the four foot on ballast/sleeper in four foot, with string of CWR present. Underlying cause: Frost that night along with leaf contamination causing sleepers to become hazardous to walk on along with CWR laid in four foot hindering walking Remedial action: If possible, walk to site using the other road to push to site, as this had no rail dropped in the four foot, however, RRV may have been on that road, so forcing the team to walk in a more hazardous route.  When planning re-visits to job, if possible plan to walk to site on the road that is not hindered with CWR placed in walking route. Underlying cause: Inadequate/insufficient lighting for walking  Remedial action: Explore option of fixing temporary lights to Robel grinder to better illuminate walking route. If possible, have trolley in close proximity with battery lights extended to illuminate the walking route Underlying cause: Pushing grinder may have led to poor posture so hindering natural walking posture. Remedial action: Explore option of carriage racking for trolley to enable grinder to be transported to site on mechanised trolley rather than pushing as individual item of plant. Underlying cause: Welders waiting long period of time following the initial flame cuts of rails Remedial action: To prevent, is it possible for Pway to have trained members of teams to undertake the flame cutting of rail? This would mean that welders could either be planned to achieve two work activities and or prevent long times of non productivity sitting in van waiting to be called upon.

No grazing. The IP (injured Person) was part of a 4-man team sent to transport a 30' length of rail needed to remove a rail defect using two rail scoots. The new rail being moved was approximately 40ch from the defect site. The scoots each had two people to push and counter balance the rail that was positioned in the 4' for the line. The IP was positioned by the scooter at the back and was positioned nearest the suspended rail. As the team pushed the scoots with the loaded rail there was a sudden jolt and the scoots stopped abruptly causing the IP to fall over landing on their left arm and hitting their right arm on the fixed rail of the line on which they were walking.

SCO 47581,"The Drill team dug a narrow trial-hole, approximately 150/200mm wide and 1.2m deep, to check for services in the location of a GI operation. The Crane Controller, straight after the hole was dug, then offloaded the GI Rig and whilst doing so stepped / fell into the hand dug hole when stepping off the ballast shoulder. He slipped down to his thigh and his boot became stuck in the hole before he managed to lift himself up. The operative stated that his ankle and leg were okay and continued to work the remainder of the shift without complaint, however, they have since advised that their right knee and ankle were a little sore and are taking painkillers. Immediate cause: The immediate cause of the event was the Crane Controller inadvertently stepping into the trial hole, thus loosing his footing for a short period of time.  Underlying cause: An underlying cause was the lack of consideration within the risk assessment for 'working at height'. Consequently, appropriate mitigations were not in place to safeguard the crane controller from stepping into the bore hole.  Remedial actions: VolkerRail has implemented remedial action to address the risks associated with 'working from height' by ensuring that trial holes are covered immediately after the machine has completed the pile movement. This action will be included within the projects documented safe system of work, and briefed to the team undertaking the task.   VolkerRail will highlight the findings of this investigation to the relevant subcontractors to ensure that the task risk assessment is updated to reflect work at height activities and corresponding control measures.  Underlying cause: An underlying cause was lack of detail within the Task Brief Sheet (TBS) with regards to the management of an open excavations/ bore holes, taking into consideration the specific requirements of this task.

Lost time","Late report. The IP decided to walk to and from the site of work on the 17/11/2020. The IP was walking back from 8235 point at Heathrow T5 after completing points maintenance. The IP was walking in 6ft in the down tunnel between T5 and CTA. The tunnel was well lit and the IP had a working head torch and was wearing the correct PPE. The IP was also wearing steel cap boots with a high top provided NR.  As the IP was walking in 6ft carrying a NR back pack, containing cleaning lubricants, brushes and rags. The IP then stepped on a exposed metal barb and lost their balance, resulting in a twisted right ankle. The metal barb was roughly 3 inches in height and 1/2 an inch thick. The exposed metal barb was located 4 inches from the tunnel wall. After the fall the IP continued to walk to the egress point, which was 1km away. The accident happened at 24km 535m the egress point was at 24km 535m. Once the IP off tracked they went to the G1 storage cage to put away the equipment. They went to the B4 office to phone the Network Rail Supervisor to report the accident. The NR supervisor then instructed the IP to inform fault control and log the incident and also email the section manager. Fault control told the IP to send a report to the section manager, so the IP didn't report it personally until the next day at 18:00 (18/11/2020).  The IP did not attend Hospital or seek guidance from a GP. The IP believed the injury was worse due to twisting right ankle where the IP had surgery on in October 2017.  The IP was currently off work recovering at home. Immediate cause - The immediate cause was the IP unaware of the exposed barb when walking towards it.  Underlying cause - The barb was exposed, had not been identified before and had not been made clearly visible to staff to avoid until the hazard could be removed.  Remedial actions - The barb should be removed from the concrete slab and until it is removed it needs to be clearly marked - this work was planned for 10/12/20 and had been made clearly visible until then.

IP was working with GreenMech Chipper in accordance with training so had to stand on the rubber tracks when loosening and redirecting outlet chute. It had been raining throughout the morning so everything was wet, increased risk. Remedial Action:- Stand down safety discussion carried out with all Off-Track Maintenance staff.  Robust ""Take 5"" process developed with input from staff to ensure refocus on site when changing tasks and formal recorded rebrief to confirm. Future process agreed for PIC/COSS to stand apart from work, to observe and maintain correct protocols, exclusion zones and take note of changing weather conditions and impact on work area.  Planning process for sites of work being reviewed taking cognisance of potential underfoot conditions or hidden hazards. Increased assurance checks being carried out with scheduled PGSI inspections and unannounced surveillance checks undertaken by Supervisor, Section Manager, TME and WHSEA.

He fell over and cut his right forearm. He was sent to the George Eliot hospital for a potential Tetanus jab.   No lost time confirmed. Immediate cause: The Nominated person tripped and fell on a signalling cable that was running along the cess and was not housed in a troughing route. Underlying cause: The work was being performed at night time, and the only lighting provided was the IP's cap lamp (an LED Lenser head torch which offered a good degree of personal lighting). Remedial actions: The IP has checked his head torch, and is happy that it provides a good level of lighting. Underlying cause: The location where the incident occurred has a lot of signalling cable running along the cess, rather than within troughing routes.  In the opinion of the IP, there is a risk of further incidents in this location due to the volume of cable in the vicinity. Remedial actions: There is a potential that the cables in the cess at this location form part of ongoing installation works, and require tidying up by the project responsible. Alternatively, it may be that the cables are existing infrastructure, and require covering with ballast, or installing in a troughing route. Recommendation - for Stafford DU to make inquiries to ascertain whether an ongoing project is responsible for the cables at this location, and either: 1) to liaise with the project to ensure they are made safe; or if the cable are not related to an ongoing project: 2) to put in place a plan to make the cables safe  Stafford DU to review the location of the accident and plan for the cables to be returned into the troughing.

[SCO47917] IP-GW&C,"A UK Rail Earthing Assistant twisted his left ankle while walking on ballast at Ladbroke Grove when his foot got stuck. The IP went to hospital after returning to his car to get his ankle checked as it was swollen. Staff at the hospital asked him to make an appointment with his GP. While working at Ladbrook undertaking isolation duties on the Capital Delivery project Earthing Assistant was walking back after the earths had been placed with his Appointed Person (AP). The IP was walking on ballast and his left foot got stuck and in turn twisted his left ankle. This was not witnessed by the AP but he noticed while looking back to confirm that the EA was OK, that he was limping. The AP questioned the EA who stated he had gone over on his ankle and was in pain. The EA returned to the access point where his ankle was checked and found to be very swollen. The EA went with a friend to hospital. He was not assessed at hospital but went home and advised to take paracetamol for the pain and see his GP. The AP offered to take the EA to hospital but he refused stating he had friend who would come for him and then his car would not be left at the station and he would then go to A & E. This did not seem to have happened as A & E would have given preliminary x-ray results before discharging the IP. The IP was asked for evidence of the visit and had not supplied any, leading to the belief that he had not attended A&E but just went to his GP, who then sent him for x-ray. The ballast of the cess, which had been the walking route where the work was taking place, was examined on 13-12-20 and there were no areas that could be seen as uneven or having voids and nothing was embedded that could have caused a trip or slip. As the work was of a transient nature the lighting was only task lights (head torches). The EA had been wearing the correct Network Rail approved footwear and the boots were fastened. Fatigue was discounted as a reason for the trip/slip.  Post incident investigation note : The IP went to get his ankle x-rayed on 08-12-20. It showed no soft tissue damage and no broken bones, although the report did indicate early signs of arthritis.  Welfare checks were undertaken and evidence of the x-ray were requested but the IP did not respond to phone calls or provided evidence of the  x-ray results until 21-12-20.  The IP was due to work his next shift on the 12-12-20 but phoned in to state he was not fit to work this shift due to pain.    A stand-down on accident/incident/Close Call reporting and cooperating with your employer was undertaken by Keltbray. This included instructing all that this would not be taken as an issue and no-one would be condemned or suffer any consequences for doing this.   UK Rail advised that they would no longer be sponsoring this individual. This is not due to any pressure from Network Rail or Keltbray and just a business decision as he has not been helpful in the investigation.  Immediate cause - Walking on ballast at night not seeing uneven ground causing ankle to twist over. The IP was wearing the correct compliant footwear and it was laced up securely. Underlying cause - Walking at night with only task lighting on ballast.   Remedial action - Raise Close Calls if the ground is uneven or there are slip/trip hazards in the location of the work or on route to the work. The AP will walk out and photograph the area in day light to highlight any places that could cause problems and then log them to ensure the AP/EA's are aware and avoid.  Unsafe act - Walking on ballast at night and turned ankle. Was the action deliberate - No. The Earthing Assistant duties require them to walk to site of Isolation Designated Earthing Points (DEP) . Informed about procedures - Yes. The AP/PIC would have briefed all his teams to be aware of underfoot conditions and to take care while walking on ballast. This is also part of sentinel PTS training.

L1: At 1607hrs on 20th December 2020, an AM1 operative had an accident whereby they fell onto a bracket used for cable encasement and cut the top of his leg.  AM1 were carrying out a cable slew at Cow Lane Under bridge on behalf of the client Dyer and Butler, and were tasked with placing the HV cables into temporary split ducting, and slewing the cables on to a temporary scaffold bridge set up to enable the existing bridge to be replaced during weekend 39/40. Whilst Slewing the cables the IP placed his foot on to a trough encasement bracket that was above ground level to gain some additional height / leverage in order to assist with moving the cables onto the temporary scaffold arrangement, whilst carrying out this action the IP's foot slipped off the bracket which led to him falling onto the corner of the bracket, causing a laceration to the rear his upper left leg.  The IP then left the site of work to go to the welfare where he had a conversation with the 1st aider,  and made the decision to go straight to A&E which was 4 minutes away (Queen Alexandra). One of the AM1 operatives drove him here to receive treatment.  Am1 have carried out an investigation, we have taken statements from his colleagues and are in regular contact with the IP to check on his progress. The IP returned home following treatment, after having his dressing changed and injury assessed he return to site based work on the Thursday. It has been confirmed the IP was fit for normal duties on the Monday, but was on a planned training course. Immediate cause: IP was assisting with lifting a cable out of its permanent trough and onto a temporary scaffold bridge, he placed his foot onto a 'J bracket' attached to a concrete post to gain some leverage,The 'J bracket' was secured to the concrete post by a single bolt, moved freely and was not stable. When the IP was used the bracket as a step, his foot slipped and caused him to fall onto the bracket which was at knee height, thus resulting in a cut to his upper leg. Underlying cause: The ground level fell away (gradient / banked environment) at that location meaning the operative needed to gain some extra height to be able to move the cables into the desired location. Temporary local grading of the area with additional ballast could have been carried out or an alternative, proprietary means of access could have been used, the IP didn't raise any issues and made the decision to use the J bracket as a step The quickest but not the safest route led to the above accident, the IP made a poor decision. A scaffold tower and a podium were both available on site. Remedial action: The IP should have stopped work and raised the height issue, the ground could have been backfilled, graded to a higher level to improve underfoot conditions or a proprietary means of access supplied.  The site team / D&B have reiterated the need to Stop and Take 5,  Removal of Bracket, post or both to remove potential for above accident from happening Find an alternative action to complete works.",Level,,,"Network Rail, Other, CrossCountry",Infrastructure worker,,Error or violation; Other; The person's environment,Cause not established; Failing to see or notice hazard; Surface condition,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

Both were treated for minor injuries at Wythenshaw Hospital and Welder 1 had 5 days lost time as a result of the incident. Immediate cause: Lost time injury: Whilst carrying out a regular two person lift with W2 of a box containing Oxy Fuel cutting/heating equipment, W1 lost his footing on the unstable high ballast shoulder causing him to fall onto his knee also, pulling W2’s shoulder as he fell.  Underlying cause: Suitability of access point: Gradient and Underfoot Conditions. After arriving at a safer solution with the Stressing Supervisor ie offload in an area with less hazardous underfoot conditions and where the ballast shoulder was near level with the rail.  The two welders did not wait as instructed by the Stressing Supervisor and proceeded to conduct the lift from the original unsuitable location that had been identified by W1. Access conditions were compounded by snow covering. Root cause: Failure to follow instructions: W1 deviated from the Dynamic Risk Assessment undertaken between W1 and Stressing Supervisor and ignored the Stressing Supervisors instructions to wait and proceeded to offload in an area of known poor underfoot conditions. Planning: Although an approved access point consideration should have been given at planning stage in identifying a more suitable access point for welders to access/egress track whilst carrying welding equipment.

AS THE EVENT IS A RIDDOR THE ORR WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THE EVENT FOR A SECOND TIME. THE DETAILS RECORDED BELOW HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE LEVEL 1 REPORT. The IP along with his team were completing U15 inspections using lookout protection when they approached a red zone prohibited area. The team downed tools and stepped into a position of safety at the bottom of the access steps at Crockleford Road Bridge whilst the COSS contacted the Signaller to take a line blockage.  Once the line blockage had been granted, the IP walked along the cess, behind the signal on a sloped embankment to retrieve his sperry rail instrument which had been left next to a catch pit. Once retrieved, the IP moved towards the track as his foot came into contact with a sloped troughing lid that had been placed to protect signalling cable.  The IP subsequently slipped on the toughing lid which was damp due to the previous days weather conditions and fell over, twisting his right ankle. The IP was taken directly to hospital where it was confirmed, he had broken his ankle. The IP has been advised to rest for a period of approximately 8 weeks to allow for recovery.  The IP has over 37 years railway experience all if which has been spent trackside with a very good safety record and no previous accidents or incidents.

Due to the recent weather conditions and position of the troughing lid, this caused a hazard which caused the IP to slip and fall. Underlying causes: Inadequate safe cess and inappropriate placement of troughing lid.  IP walked behind signal and along cess which was uneven to retrieve his sperry rail instrument however, had they had walked around the front of the signal and remained on the ballast, he would have avoided the troughing lid and likely not fallen and injured himself.  Underlying causes classification: Work environment Remedial action: Troughing lid close called and moved from sloped position. Cables covered with flat level surface to prevent staff slipping down and injuring themselves.  Re enactment completed 13.01.21 and WHSEA issued safety alert to all staff in Anglia as a reminder to take 5 before during and after all tasks to ensure they are assessing their work environment and underfoot conditions.

They were climbing up a tree using spikes.  At around 15ft up, the spikes gave way and they slid down the pole, they landed on their feet with their left foot feeling sore they hobbled off site to be taken to hospital. No first aid was given.  IP was taken to hospital. Follow up conversation with IP, who had had advice to take rest and take the rest of the week off. Immediate cause: Climber's configuration of both primary climbing and personal fall protection system looped around stem of tree was not sufficient to stop the fall when climber slipped and not in line with industry best practice. Underlying cause: Not all Climber training courses cover industry recognised techniques to increase friction on stem and help system grip in event of a slip. Climber was aware of technique to use lanyard in crossed position to increase friction and sometimes uses double wrap when needs to get close to stem, but normally doesn't cross or double wrap and ""did not think to do so on this occasion"". The small diameter and lack of branch features of the ash tree made it difficult to climb. The Ash was damp due to rain and Ash bark is smooth which increased the potential of a slip occurring. The daily plan and daily point of work risk assessment (PoWRA) contained bare minimum details of task and key controls, both had been reused from the previous day's activities. Ground Control need to make clear to managers and staff that their expectation was these documents should contain more details and were only used for a single day. Remedial actions: Ground Control will purchase and issue one copy of TG1 to each Arb Rail Field Team and Management Staff. Ground Control will produce briefings on key content areas and add references to TG1 into Ground Control Safety Handbook to encourage and highlight TG1's usefulness to operational staff. Ground Control will contract an external LANTRA trainer (starting w/c 18 Jan) to perform site-based observation and assessment of arboriculture skills for climbing teams on HDB project. Site-based coaching will then be developed to pick up on any improvement areas. Toolbox talk issued to all Arboriculture teams including content from Technical Guide 1 to increase knowledge of spiking ascent techniques. Ground Control have issued a safety alert and associated toolbox talk to all arboriculture teams including content from Technical Guide 1 to increase knowledge of spiking ascent techniques and appropriate adjustments for very small or large diameter trees. Ground Control will issue new PoWRA template for teams to use, this template enhances key risk controls including work at height and includes site diagrams.   During roll out of new template, Managers and teams will be briefed by HSQE Manager on the required amount of detail to be contained, HSQE and senior managers will review compliance by diarised review of POWRA photos contained in site inspections.

The onboard Train Manager reported that everything was normal until he carried out his dispatch at Leamington Spa at around 14:20. He was dispatched by the Dispatcher and after giving the driver two on the bell buzzer the driver then contacted him on the radio to say he had to run back to the loco to reset something. He asked the TM to inform Control. The driver walked back to the loco and returned to the DVT shortly after informing the TM it was ok to carry on. The train departed Leamington Spa and after roughly 2-3 minutes the TM stated he felt a brake application, and the train came to a stop. The driver informed the TM he had to reset something in his DVT and would continue shortly. Again, the train was on the move, but very shortly after another brake application occurred. The driver told the TM he needed to speak to the Signaller and that they would continue to move slowly towards Banbury. The TM made a passenger announcement and communicated with Control. During this time the train was moving very slowly but every time the train built up any speed there was a brake application. The driver contacted the Duty Fleet Manager for advice.

No first aid given. Over 7 days lost time confirmed. Additional information from Level 1 form as follows:-  On Sunday 24th January, the Birmingham Relief MOM was covering the Stourbridge MOM area from 18:00-06:00. Due to poor weather affecting the infrastructure, the MOM decided to visit Barnt Green to ensure the points were free of snow and that the points heater was working.   At 1729hrs the MOM left Stourbridge Depot to drive to Barnt Green. On arrival at Barnt Green, the MOM drove up Station Approach and continued onto the station car park which he drove around, before heading back down Station Approach and turning left towards a set of vehicular access gates labelled as 'Barnt Green Haul Road' on the access information sign. There was snow covering the ground and there was also thick snow falling at the time. The MOM was wearing an orange 'bump' cap, hi-vis jacket, hi-vis trousers, safety boots and was using a hand-held torch. The MOM got out of the vehicle and walked to the gate to unlock and open it. The next thing the MOM remembered was finding himself sat back in the vehicle. His PPE was wet and his head was hurting. He could not recall where he fell or how, but he knew he had fallen as his PPE was wet from the fall.    At 1826hrs, the MOM then rang Control to advise them what had happened. Control advised they were sending the Birmingham MOM to drive the MOM back home.  At 1827hrs Control contacted 2nd Line On Call, to advise him of the accident.  At 1831hrs, 2nd Line On Call called the MOM to check on his welfare and confirm the Birmingham MOM would be making his way over to bring him home. The 2nd Line On Call member of staff recalled the MOM sounding 'groggy and confused'.  At 1837hrs Control informed the Birmingham MOM about the accident and asked him to pick up the MOM from Barnt Green and take him home. At 1841hrs the MOM then rang the Birmingham MOM to advise him not to bother picking him up and he would make his own way back to Stourbridge. The MOM advised that picking him up would not be a problem and he was about to leave New St PSB. The MOM insisted that he was okay and did not need picking up. The MOM did not believe the MOM sounded any different than he normally did and had no reason to believe he was unsafe to drive home by himself. The MOM continued with routine duties after this call. At 1849hrs the MOM arrived back at Stourbridge Depot. Once he had transferred his kit to his car and put the keys back in the depot, he left in his car at 1858hrs. The Birmingham MOM was advised that the MOM had got home at 1940hrs. The MOM informed Control of this at 1956hrs.   Since the accident, the MOM has advised he does not remember anything about the accident or arriving home. From the moment he found himself sat in the van and realising he must have hit his head, up to how he arrived home, the MOM has no memory of what happened. As a result of the fall, he also has loss of hearing in his right ear. However, since the accident, he has also experienced other 'blackout' moments, where he finds himself somewhere he did not expect to be and cannot recall  how it happened. It is unclear whether the MOM has tripped or slipped and banged his head, causing the loss of memory or whether he 'blacked out' first and hit his head as a result of that. The MOM has since visited hospital and was found to have extremely high blood pressure. This could be the potential cause of blacking out, but continues to be investigated by medical staff.  The above timeline of events has been gathered using phone call records from those involved and CCTV from Stourbridge Depot to help put together a timeline of the MOM’s movements. Immediate cause:-  Unexplained blackout causing MOM to bang his head on the ground. Underlying cause:-  Due to the MOM being unable to remember anything from the accident, it is unclear whether the MOM tripped or slipped and banged his head, causing loss of memory or whether he 'blacked out' first and hit his head as a result of that. Remedial actions:-  The MOM has been advised that an OH referral will be made to investigate any issues that could potentially prevent him from carrying out a safety critical role. The MOM has also been advised to seek further medical advice on top of that already sought. Underlying cause:-  Regardless of how the accident happened i.e. trip/slip or blackout, MOM advised he was wearing an orange bump cap. These are issued to track workers for the purpose of patrolling, inspecting and examining. Whilst the MOM was only there to inspect the point heaters were working, it is reasonable to believe that with the snowy weather and slippy underfoot conditions a bump cap was not suitable head gear. Remedial actions:-  The MOM is to be briefed on the importance of wearing the correct level of PPE according to the weather conditions or environment around him. This will also be briefed to the wider MOM team to prevent similar accidents happening.",,,,"Network Rail, West Midlands Trains",Other: MOM,Other duties: Inspecting points,Cause not known,Cause not known,0.01,Workforce (on-duty): Severe 7

Contractor slipped on ballast near Pontrilas. SCO48137,"A Ganymede contract worker twisted his ankle whilst working at 13 miles 49 chains near Pontrilas. He did not require first aid or a visit to hospital and continued working to end of shift. Level 1 report: The IP, while acting as Machine Controller walked around the RRV into the 4 foot and slipped off a sleeper into a shallow sleeper crib resulting in him twisting his left ankle, the depth from sleeper to ballast level was between 2 and 3 inches at the area near the rail where the shape of the concrete sleeper raises in height toward the housing. The IP had the accident at approximately 01:00 but continued to work and reported the accident to the Works Delivery Manager and Person in Charge at approximately 05:30. For the duration of the shift the IP was walking with his machine and had to travel (walk due to COVID restrictions) to a switch approximately 1/2 mile away to cross the RRV between the roads, coupled with the task of scrapping out rail meant he undertook considerable walking on ballast throughout the shift which may have aggregated the ankle injury further.  The work taking place on the site was re-railing so there was no excavation/removal of ballast taking place on site. Lighting at the worksite was provided by tower lighting, RRV lights, head torches and task specific lighting by way of mobile Milwaukee units, away from the worksite (at the access point and at the switches used to cross the RRV between the roads was provided by the light of the RRV and head torches. At the time of the accident and throughout the shift the weather was cold (0 degrees confirmed as rail temperatures were taken throughout) but dry, there was no frost or ice on the ground. The location of the worksite is in an area with a known ""strained relationship"" between Network Rail and the landowner, therefore access to the infrastructure was at a location 3 miles away from the worksite with staff being transported by man carrier to and from.  Due to the relationship the team had only been to the site on two occasions, once for the raildrop and secondly on the night of the work taking place, therefore scoping was limited and areas of shallow beds had not been picked up, however, from photographs taken from the site following identify the drop to only be a approximately 2 and 3 inches so is unlikely to have been identifed as a risk prior and added to the TBS. Immediate cause: The IP's foot slipping off the concrete sleeper causing him to drop between 2 to 3 inches into a low ballast crib between the sleepers. Underlying cause: The IP slipped very early into his shift (approximately 01:00) but failed to report the accident to either the PIC or WDM until approximately 05:00, for the duration of the shift the IP was walking with his machine and had to travel (walk due to COVID restrictions) to a switch approximately 1/2 mile away to cross the RRV between the roads, coupled with the task of scrapping out rail meant he undertook considerable walking on ballast throughout the shift which may have aggregated the ankle injury further. Remedial action: Had the IP reported straight away to the PIC/WDM they could have reviewed the activities required and looked to source another MC for the shift from the other team members on site or through the ""on call system"" and given the IP time to rest his ankle or undertake a task that required less walking throughout the shift. Both the IP and the LOSC have been reminded of the reporting requirements for accidents and incidents following. Underlying cause: Due to the relationship the team had only been to the site on two occasions, once for the raildrop and secondly on the night of the work taking place, therefore scoping was limited and areas of shallow beds had not been picked up.  Remedial action: Photographs taken from the site following identify the drop to only be a approximately 2 - 3 inches so is unlikely to have been identified as a risk prior and added to the TBS, however, this example has been shared with the team as part of the periodic team brief for consideration for future scoping visits. Underlying cause: Small areas of low ballast between some of the sleepers. Remedial action: The work taking place on the site was re-railing so there was no excavation/removal of ballast taking place on site, however, had there been time to undertake more site scoping this could have been picked up and although not part of the ""remit"" small areas of low ballast could have been topped up on site via a tonne bag of ballast.

The IP immediately got to his feet. He felt no adverse effects from the incident and, as a result he carried on his normal duties for the rest of the day, not thinking anything more of the incident. He did not report this and drove home at the end of his shift. The following morning, the IP got out of bed and noticed he had some minor discomfort in his lower back whilst sitting / moving around. The IP reported the incident internally to the head of his department and the compliance team for investigation. Immediate cause - The IP walked down the embankment towards the fence line, slipped causing him to loose his footing and land on the right hand side of his bottom causing a jolt to his lower back. Underlying cause - The IP did not assess the risk before heading towards the fence line, not taking into account the poor weather and underfoot conditions.   Remedial action - Re-brief IP on the importance of checking access and site conditions prior to commencing work (i.e. Take 5 for Safety & QTS Stop, Think, Act & Review processes). This is to include dynamically risk assessing potential issues caused by poor weather conditions. Where access cannot be achieved due to poor underfoot conditions and pose of risk of slips/falls, utilising Worksafe and where possible re-planning access. Unsafe act - The IP slipped due to poor weather / underfoot conditions. Was the action deliberate - No. The IP believed that he was using suitable route to access the fence line without fully considering the actual underfoot conditions and location hazards. Informed about procedures - Yes. The IP is fully aware of site procedures, especially assessing access and site conditions.  Procedures clear & workable - Yes. All procedures are deemed clear and workable, the IP had all information with him (TBS, etc).  Behavioural cause - Slip/lapse.

Shrewsbury DU P'way staff fell into a catch pit at Wooferton,"Whilst walking to inspect drainage at Wooferton, a new GRP pit cover was insecure, as the injured person stepped onto the lid of the catch pit, the lid slipped away and and he fell into the the drainage pit below. Level 1 report: While completing a track inspection the IP walked to the cess to inspect a drainage catch pit. IP stepped on a loose GRP catchpit lid. The lid slipped away and the lid and IP fell three feet into the chamber. This resulted in some minor grazes and a small bruise and cut to the left shin. The catchpit lid was a non standard grey lattice GRP which had been cut down in size to sit within the chamber ring and it was not secured with the correct fixings to the GRP top ring. Notes, subsequent to accident review, inquiries were made to Wales MDR, Hereford Pway and Hereford Off Track to ascertain who/when this catchpit had been replaced. WHSEA did undertake a review of all close calls to try to identify as well but, there are c7500 close call records and it was difficult to identify this location due to poor close call description/location data. Non can identify or confirm when and who, and Off Track do not have any AMP documentation for this either. On 27/02/21 Hereford Off Track replaced this catchpit cover with the correct blue GRP type and fixed it in place with the correct fixings. Immediate cause: IP stood on the catchpit lid to inspect the drain beneath. Drainage catchpit directly adjacent to a RRAP had been damaged, presumably by RRV. The repaired catchpit was built up with GRP rings and a non standard GRP lid cut to size. The lid was not secured as it should have been, instead cut to size and sat semi securely within the rim of the pit rings. Underlying cause: New lids like this are typically blue GRP fixed to the chamber and safe to stand on to inspect the drain beneath. Repair work not completed to standard and the deficiency had not been identified since. The incorrect materials were used for the lid.

In the course of this he stepped down the embankment to inspect a broken catch pit lid but what he thought was solid ground was in fact dense vegetation, leading to a bigger step than anticipated. He fell and caught his leg on a piece of scrap rail, awkwardly twisting his right knee. He was able to walk slowly back to the van unaided but his knee was painful. He did not believe he required hospital treatment and went home to rest the knee. The injured person was going to inform his line manager of the accident and expected to be back to work the next day. First aid was not administered on site. Updates: Update provided by Off Track Section Manager. The injured person was able to attend work for their next booked shift with no problems.  No hospital treatment had been sought and the injured person had made a full recovery. L1 updates: The member of the Drainage Team was working on the Up main at Durston (157m) carrying out drainage maintenance with planned line blocks. Due to a large gap between line blocks (at around 19:50) the IP and his colleague walked down the up cess looking at catch pits to see which ones required digging out in the next line block. The IP came across some concrete lids which were 2 metres away from the line at the bottom of the ballast shoulder, he stepped down to investigate to see if this was part of the drainage system onto what he thought was hard ground, but the step down was deeper than he thought and covered in vegetation. This caused him to lose balance and fall over. Under the ivy was a length of rail that was running along the bank. This was higher than the ground he was standing onto and wrenched his knee. Later his knee started to feel uneasy when walking,  so he handed back the line block and went back to the Team vehicle. Immediate cause - IP misjudged vegetation (Ivy) for firm ground, this caused the IP to stumble through the vegetation and onto section of scrap rail.  Underlying cause - Stepping onto thick vegetation without assessing if the underfoot conditions were suitable to take the IP's full weight. The task was being carried out in hours of darkness, this would have meant the IP would not have been able to identify the drop in the vegetation by visually inspecting. The section of rail that the IP twisted his knee upon was covered in ivy and not easily visible. The IP was wearing a head torch to provide lighting at the site - this may not have been sufficient to identify the vegetation/rail. The thick vegetation would have also been potentially been difficult in daylight to observe if it was suitable to stand on. Remedial actions - Areas of vegetation( underfoot conditions)  to be assessed prior to walking/working/stepping . The rail seem hidden from view  - Section Manager Track to visit the site and plan to remove the rail.  Off Track to ensure that this is Close Called.  Action for individual - Assess underfoot conditions prior to and during work.

The contractor's leg went through the gap and had to catch himself on his arm, sustaining a scratch sustained to right arm.  The contractor was ok to continue duty and no time off work was required. Immediate cause: The IP injuring his forearm after falling against a scaffolding clip after stepping back on to an unsupported scaffolding board (trap end). Underlying cause: Due to the scaffolding board not being secured (although designed and built as per standard and drawings) it had moved along the supporting board underneath to such an extent that it became unsafe . This created a trap end which the IP stepped on causing the fall and the arm injury.  Remedial action: Once the IP was assessed for what level of medical attention needed, all staff exited the scaffolding to a position of safety . The scaffolding contractor was notified and attended site. The board that caused the fall and the adjacent three were moved to their original position and fixed down to prevent a recurrence. The scaffolding was inspected and was returned in to service. Underlying cause: The team using the scaffolding hadn't noticed the movement of the boards.  Remedial action: A toolbox talk to be produced highlighting what to look out for during daily pre-use checks. As this was an unknown issue, toolbox talk to be shared across industry partners. Underlying cause: Due to the configuration of the scaffolding and local features such as a narrow passage, the need to have access to the loading bay, this created an unique set of circumstances on the final build of the scaffolding. Remedial action: QED have implemented 2 additional measures to secure the boards at this transitional point from access staircase to working platform Underlying cause: Materials stacked at the opening to the access staircase, narrowing the gap. This could have had a contributing factor to the boards being kicked and moved (this has been rectified by the boards being screwed down and the walkway is now clear).

The IP was part of the afternoon shift working just beyond the gas works tunnel’s southern portal during projects planned partial closure. The track within the tunnel was relatively new with no obstruction present and sufficient LED link lighting on both sides throughout the tunnel. There was adequate space within the tunnel as it boasts of a two-track configuration. During the course of their works, IP (and another colleague) were instructed by Supervisor (who was managing works just outside the tunnel) to get keying hammers from inside the tunnel. At around 1930 hrs. as the IP was walking through the tunnel in the 4ft carrying a keying hammer, he stepped onto the base of the magnet and slipped causing his left ankle to roll over. The IP was wearing safety boots/ helmet with lamp during his works.  First aid offered but declined as injury was not a major concern for the IP. However, as the IP was in pain, he did not continue with his shift and was taken home by taxi. He reported for his next scheduled shift on 8th March. Immediate cause: Vital (blue hat) trackman slipped and sprained his left ankle (ankle rollover) when he stepped onto the base of a track magnet. Underlying cause: Wet surfaces (magnet & safety boots) caused lack of adequate traction. (condensation causes increase in humidity within a tunnel environment) Remedial actions: Track within GTW (east bore) was relatively new with no obstructions present. There was adequate space within the tunnel as it boasts of a two-track configuration. However, track was generally a hazardous environment where staff were always expected to walk ballast to ballast, not to walk/stand on rails and beware of fixed rail equipment and cables.

No hospital visit was required. 12 days lost time added as per level 1 Work was completed and staff had walked back to egress point, pushing tools on a skate. At the egress point, the IP was carrying a hammer and pan-setter down the steps. The concrete step moved under his weight as the timber upright gave way. This caused IP to fall forwards down 2 steps, twisting his leg, eventually landing on his back. Due to carrying tools, he was not using the handrail, but luckily wearing kneepads which prevented a serious injury as he hit his knee during the fall. Immediate cause: Steps moved slightly when the IP stood on them causing him to overbalance and fall forwards. Underlying cause: The two flag stones which made the step were set sloping down/forwards and wobbled sideways. Timber retaining step had rotted. Deterioration in quality of access point.  IP decided to change access point, rather than using the planned access as parking space at this location was restrictive due to being in a residential area.

DU Shrewsbury Off Track staff slipped into a rabbit hole and twisted his ankle at Abergavenny,"Hereford Off Track staff twisted his left ankle while carrying out de-vegetation work in the Abergavenny area. While carrying out the work his foot slipped down a rabbit hole. No time off work was anticipated. Level 1 report: The team on site were undertaking the de-vegetation of blackthorn bushes in the Abergavenny area at 11 miles 220 yards to 5 miles 770 yards under Line Block Protection.  It was initially planned that the Safe System of Work (SSoW) would also be undertaken at some points with a Site Warden. However, as the Site Warden was unavailable on the day, only the work be carried out with a Line Block was undertaken. The work undertaken was to create safe access routes in the area by removing the overgrown blackthorn bushes.  Due to the work activity needing to be undertaken in nesting season, the work was planned so that the bushes were cut back using hand cuts from the chainsaws. Prior to the work, the site had been visited previously by the Safe Work Pack (SWP) planner and members of the team four months prior when assisting the Signal & Technician (S&T) team with a cable removal in the area.  The Injured Person (IP) was undertaking the role of Person In Charge (PIC)/ Controller of Site Safety (COSS) on the day. They had signed the SWP alongside the Planner and Responsible Manager on the 01/04/2021 on the Thursday prior. This is the weekday when PICs review their SWP in the Hereford Off-Track team.  Once on the site, the IP reviewed and briefed the SSoW to the team and completed a Points of Work Risk Assessment (POWRA) as well as the necessary Bird Breeding Form for the area. Both of the latter forms allowed an opportunity for the IP to assess the site, with the POWRA in place to assess dynamically any new risks from the site that day posed to the team that the SSoWP had not.  The controls for slips and trips on the day were briefed via the Generic Track Risk Task Risk Control Sheet (TRCS) NR/L3/ MTC/RCS0216/ TK100.  This included controls for continuous checking of site, for the risk, use of  PPE, and weather considerations. The TRCS Underfoot Conditions TRCS NR/L3/ MTC/RCS0216/ GH02 linked in this TRCS to reference were not identified in SSOWP as it was felt Generic track risk Control Sheet identified the relevant risks. Under footing conditions were not noted in POWRA on the day . As PIC/COSS on the day the IP was responsible for a team of four including themselves. The team on site included included chainsaw operatives from contracted Arborists at RSS.  The IP was undertaking chainsaw activities alongside the team on the day. They were leading the group from the front when moving across the area and taking regular breaks in activity to look up and check on the team.  Whilst commencing the de-vegetation works the IP has placed their foot in an unseen rabbit hole. The hole was obscured by vegetation and due to the amount of vegetation as signs of rabbits were not seen on the site assessment checks. The IP has twisted their left ankle by stepping into unseen rabbit hole.  The work stopped after the accident as IP was the PIC/COSS.  At the time of the accident the IP felt minor pain in their left foot, for this reason they drove home and went to ice and rest their ankle.  Throughout the afternoon/ early evening their ankle became increasingly sore and following advice from their Line Manager, they went to the hospital for an X-Ray. The X ray showed a sprain and IP has confirmed stiffness of the ankle.  The IP returned to work on the 13/04/2021 and confirmed that their ankle now felt better. Work will commence at the same site on the 14/01/2021. The IP and Line Manager confirmed that at the time of the incident the IP did not feel fatigued or had any personal issues of note that could have led to the incident. IP has been confirmed to be wearing appropriate PPE. The IP confirmed their travel to the site on the day was 1 hour.  Immediate cause: IP has placed foot in unseen rabbit hole. Underlying cause: Rabbit hole covered by on site vegetation that had not been seen on the day.  Remedial action: The implementation of site walk outs before commencing activity may have shown signs of animal habitat such as the rabbit holes prior to commencing the activity.This practice would allow the time and focus for the PIC to understand the site and potential hazards to control.  Underlying cause: Potential for IP distraction from undertaking the role of both chainsaw operative and PIC. This may have reduced ability to ensure their own safety as both roles require a high level of attention.  Remedial action: It is practice in the Hereford Off-Track section to allow the PIC to decide if on a low risk activity that they also commence in the activity as well hold PIC duties if they believe safe and reasonably practicable to do so.  This practice is to be reviewed by team and Safety advisors to understand further if a safety risk is posed.  Underlying cause: Under footing conditions were not highlighted in dynamic site assessment. Whilst may not be a direct link to the accident, understanding of how to complete the form and have on site discussions of risks have the potential to enforce caution against high risk areas for the off-track teams such as slips and trips. Remedial action: As a wider piece of work for the off-track team, support will be provided on how to encourage on site conversations and the Take 5 message will the culture behaviour team.

IRIS11072. RIDDOR 7 plus","UPDATE 10/12/2021 provided in email from SHE Assistant  Route Services: I have today been advised that the IP returned on light duties but then decided to leave and continue his recovery elsewhere.  His LDOS was 21/10/2021 which totals to 173 days lost time.  I have entered the return to work on full duties date as the day the IP left Network Rail.  Whilst returning to the access point following the completion of works, NRL operative injured his ankle and lower leg, walking on ballast. As the IP was walking his foot turned on the ballast whilst his leg remained in position, this caused the leg to twist. This led to him being unable to walk and therefore the team carrying him off site. An ambulance was called but the team were advised it could be up to a 2 hour wait, this was not suitable due to the pain, so the team members drove him to the Royal Free London hospital. Upon consultation, it was confirmed that Jasper had broken his leg. Immediate cause - The immediate cause was the IPs foot remaining on the ballast whilst his leg continued to move. There has been no report of over or under ballasting and no major uneven surfaces aside for what you would come to expect when walking on ballast. IP informed that his leg just gave way for no apparent reason Underlying cause - Walking on a ballasted surface is the only underlying cause. There were no environmental issues,visibility was good, correct PPE was in place etc. Remedial actions - A brief has been created to highlight the importance of being aware of underfoot conditions, ensuring correct PPE is worn, whilst also highlighting the swift actions of the COSS/PIC and team members in the way they responded to the injured person and how this should be followed for all incidents UPDATE: IP has been further signed off until 23 August 2021 (Source: SHE Assistant Route Services) on the 30th July 2021 07/09/2021 UPDATE: Update 06/09/2021- Phased return to work is due by 20/09/2021.

IRIS 11219","A Senior PICOP slipped down the embankment at Slough and fell over backwards, cutting his head. A paramedic attended and dealt with the IP. There was no requirement to visit hospital. The member of staff reported for duty the following night for their shift. The incident occurred at Leigh Road 19m 74ch where the PICOP had been lifting protection It was observed that the access point used was one for emergency access only, the gate was plated as such, and the access point was not listed in the hazard directory. A review of access points will be undertaken. The member of staff saw the ES assistant accessing the track, and assumed [wrongly] that it would be time for them to lift protection soon. They accessed via the Leigh Road bridge access point, which was deemed as an ""Emergency Access Only"" access point. They slipped down the bank leading from the gate to the track and fell, sustaining a cut to the back of their head. They were told to go back to the van, and another member of staff nearby was directed to go and check on the injured person. The other member of staff reported that there was a cut on the back of the IP's head, which was bleeding. The injured person was told to ring an ambulance. The ambulance attended, and after assessing injured person, it was deemed to be a non-serious injury. Paramedics advised there was no issue for injured person to drive themselves home, pulling over and re-calling the ambulance service should they feel any further symptoms. Immediate cause - Member of staff slipped down a relatively steep bank which led to the track, causing injury to the back of their head. Underlying cause - The injured person had accessed at an Emergency Only access point [along with ES assistant staff], which had an unsuitable bank to climb down to access the track side. When interviewed, the injured person stated that they were in the process of ""Taking 5 for safety"" as to if / how best to access down the bank, when they then slipped. Underlying cause - The member of staff had paperwork, which stated that they should access at this location. Unsafe act - Accessed down a steep bank, slipping and causing themselves injury. Was the action deliberate - No. Action was not deliberate, it was an accident. Member of staff could have taken 5 for safety and questioned whether or not it was safe to access here, regardless of whether it was usual practice or not. Informed about procedures - Yes. Member of staff is well informed about taking 5 for safety and thinking through their actions. This was re-briefed on the weekly safety briefing only a couple of hours prior. Member of staff did state they were taking 5 to think about the best way to access down the bank when they slipped - but they should have stood back in a position of safety and considered if it was safe to access down the bank at all. Procedures clear & workable - Yes. This was a slip / lapse in judgement on behalf of the member of staff. They should have more carefully considered if this was an appropriate place to access, however their paperwork stated this location, and it was common practice to access here. Unsafe act - Planned paperwork for Unauthorised Access Point. Was the action deliberate - Yes. The planner deliberately planned this access point for use as it was common practice to do so. Was the action well intentioned - Yes. The action was well intentioned because this was the standard access point for this location, which had always been used for many years. The planner had never received any negative feedback about this location. They had never been to the location before themselves and was therefore unaware that this was deemed as emergency access only. Informed about procedures - No. The planner was not aware that this was an emergency access only. They had never visited the location themselves in person. They had never received any feedback regarding the location. When questioned regarding the access point not being listed in the Hazard Directory, they stated that there are a couple of locations which are not listed, but that are still regularly used. They did not think it was an issue, as there is the facility to add the access point manually on the SSOWPS system. As far as they were concerned the access point was a normal Network Rail access point, with a normal railway padlock, which had been simply missed off of the Hazard Directory for whatever reason.",Slopes and ramps,,,Network Rail,Track worker - Person In charge of possession (PICOP),Placing or removing protection,"Technical, equipment or conditions",Slippery surface; Uneven surface or small change in level,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

Two staff members were pulling opposite ways on a cable and as the cable tore apart the Technician fell into the manhole, causing injuries to their left knee.  First aid treatment was not administered and hospital treatment was not required. Absence from work was not expected. Immediate cause: Opened the chamber to access fibre joint which was removed from the chamber to allow for alterations to be made to the fibre connections. Best practice allowed for 20 meters of coiled fibre to be stored in the chamber which allowed for repairs or modifications to be made. On this occasion there was only 3 meters of spare resulting in the work taking place much closer to the open chamber than normal.  In the course of removing the outer protective cover it was decided to pull the cover from the cable rather than cutting along the length and peeling off this was done to prevent causing damage to the fibres due to the very short length available.  In the act of pulling the sheath off IP stepped sideways into the chamber with their left knee came into contact with the metal surround at the top of the chamber. Underlying cause: Shorter length of cable caused staff to be closer to the chamber than normal, also walk the dog tool should be used instead of staff pulling in different directions with force. Remedial action: Brief staff on worksite layout, always replace any lids during work or ensure to barrier round open chambers (where possible) a safe distance from open chambers where possible.  Use approved tools to remove sheathing, if other methods are to be used then specific dynamic planning must be undertaken to mitigate other possible risks.

The Injured Person slipped and the hot slag fell onto the wet sleeper.  The water and slag reacted and blew up in his face. The injured person was  treated with damp cloths and water. His hands and arms were blistered and his eyebrows were singed. The IP resumed on 22/06/2021. L1 updates: A West DU Welder suffered superficial burns to his hands, arm and face during the process of casting a thermit weld on a re-rail site in the Newton Abbot area. The two man Welding Team had cast the weld and were stripping down welding equipment as per the process timescales. The IP had taken the slag bowl off the weld to place it in the sand tray, as he was moving towards the ballast shoulder where the tray was located,  he  tripped over , leading to the slag landing on the wet concrete sleeper and ballast it exploded towards the IP and the surrounding area. The IP has reported that when he lost his footing and fell over he is not sure if he dropped the slag bowl or the slag tipped out of the bowl. Colleagues on site were able to provide first aid to the IP immediately, then taking him to A&E for his burns to be treated. The IP has subsequently be signed off work.  Immediate cause - IP suffered burns from the molten weld slag exploding when it came into contact with the wet surface of the concrete sleeper. Underlying cause - When moving the slag bowl towards the sand tray ( located approximately 3 meters away) the IP tripped , spilling the contents onto the wet sleeper . There were many tripping hazards in and around the area that the IPP was working , including the stressing kit around the location of the weld. The accident happened in hours of darkness , increasing the risk of tripping over items in and around the working area. The weather conditions were very poor with continual rain though out the shift - underfoot conditions would have slippery. Debris from the explosion did land around other staff members who were some distance away - so this indicates the importance of keeping to the exclusion zone. Remedial actions - Prevention -  placing the sand tray in close vicinity of weld would reduce the distance having to carry bowl and the risk of slips/trips/falls. As per the training provided when Thermit welding ,is being aware of the surroundings, trying to get the welders to think about how they will complete the work safely and to standard.  West DU Welding Manager - To issue a reminder to all staff to keep to the exclusion zone required as defined on the Task Risk Control Sheet around both hot works, due to how molten metal will react when in contact with moisture.  Underlying cause - The IP suffered injuries to his hands, arm and face – Failure to wear the correct PPE for the task and to take reasonable care for the health and safety of himself and of other persons who may be affected by his acts or omissions . Though PPE is the lowest level of protection - wearing the correct could have prevented the injuries to the IP The IP was not wearing  any eye protection at the time of the accident – Googles should have been worn as a minimum as per the Risk Control Sheet TK61 -   Alumino Thermic Welding. The IP did have on him shaded safety glasses ( Welding shade: 5 for working gas cutting and welding, work low energy impact BS EN166.F - these would not have been suitable for this task.  The IP has also reported that the safety glasses were misting up in the rain and had removed the eye protection. The Risk  Control Sheet TK61 states - If safety glasses introduce a risk (e.g.due to weather conditions) then the Team Leader shall assess the risk. The outcome of the assessment shall be recorded on the SWP pack and safety glasses may be removed.There is no record of this on the SWP of this. Also mentioned on the Risk Control Sheet concerning the removal of safety glasses is the following -  This does not supersede the requirements for eye protection detailed for the Task on relevant Task Risk Control Sheets. The Additional PPE Required by Task Risk Control Sheet included googles. It is not known if the IP had the correct googles in his possession at the time of the accident. The IP was wearing Traffi gloves( a general maintenance use glove) - Not gauntlets as per the Risk Control Sheet TK61 -   Alumino Thermic Welding.  – this could have prevented burns to his hands and arms. The IP has stated that the gloves he was wearing were the traffi gloves because his gauntlets were soaking wet due to the inclement weather. The Welder could have used the wet gauntlets to hold the tongs that were used to carrying the slag bowl.  There has been a suggestion that Welders have been instructed not to wear gauntlet when these are wet - Neither the Section Manager or Network Rail Welding Trainer has ever been notified of this practice. It has been mentioned that with the heat involved it is still safer to wear wet gauntlets, than rubber coated gloves. The IP was wearing a flame proof wet weather jacket and coveralls that took the majority of the blast – the molten metal burnt through both jacket and coverall. Remedial actions - The IP was not wearing the correct PPE for the task: Not wearing gauntlets as per the Risk Control Sheet TK61 -   Alumino Thermic Welding.  – this could have potentially  prevented burns to his hands and arms. At the time of writing this L1 the IP was still off work from his injuries - on his return an interview will be planned to understand why the IP was not wearing the correct PPE for the task.  The details of the injuries and the accident will be included within the West DU Period Safety Brief for Period 2 ( 2021)  - This will include the need to wear the correct PPE. Underlying cause - Process  - Photographs from the site indicate distance walked carrying the slag bowl and that the slag landed in three places on the wet concrete sleeper, not one solid lump - which could potentially mean that the molten slag was not solidified sufficiently when it landed on the wet concrete sleeper.  During the process of casting thermit welds on the rerail site, once the weld was cast the kit needs to be stripped down as per the process timescales. Contact was made with the Western Route Network Rail Welding Trainers to understand if there was an issue with the process when removing the slag bowl.  Potential Cause - Cant of the track at this point .Where removal of the slag bowl is concerned, the two minutes is pushing it to the point where if you are working on track with a level of cant( cant was 140) , one bowl will contain more slag that the other, so there is a risk the fuller bowl of the two may still not have solidified before removal, so it’s difficult to confirm if on this occasion the slag bowl was removed too early, but there is still need to remove the Universal Mount (bracket) that holds the moulds in place, and then the mould shoes ready to start “trimming” the weld after five minutes. Slag bowls cannot be left in place for any longer than the two minutes -  the Welding Trainers  believe the process is really robust and can be completed safely if the process requirements are followed. Risk Control Sheet TK61 -   Alumino Thermic Welding states that one of the Key Risk concerning Fire / Explosion (from flames, hot slag waste, hot surfaces, etc)The welding area shall be dry at all time. A Welders Tent for this risk was not used.  The IP received his initial training for the Thermit Welding process on the 26/07/2018 at Bristol training school. Remedial actions - Western Route Network Rail Welding Trainers  have mentioned that there is a lot of risk involved with welding in the wet weather, not just with the risks involved once the weld has poured and removal of kit, but it can also have an effect on the suitability of the weld, so as with any task, experience will play its part and this is probably why fortunately these types of incident are very rare with the amount of welding that goes on across the industry. Best practice -  when removing the sand tray move it on to the side of the weld with the fuller slag bowl. At the time of writing this L1 the IP was still off work from his injuries - on his return an interview will be planned to understand if the process was followed.  West DU Welding Manager - To issue a reminder to all staff to keep to the sand tray in close proximity when removing the slag bowl.  Action for individual - At the time of writing this L1 the IP was still off work from his injuries - on his return an interview will be planned to understand what led to the accident , and lessons that can be learned.  IP to check that he has all the correct PPE at his disposal for the Welding tasks. Action for manager - To assist with the production of a Route Safety Alert concerning the accident and the lessons learned. To confirm that all staff his have the correct PPE for the Welding tasks and complete the annual check. The details of the injuries and the accident will be included within the West DU Period Safety Brief for Period 2 ( 2021)  - This will include the need to wear the correct PPE.

The team leader decided to use this access point as this is closest to the site. Access from Gypsy lane will lead to reduced amount of hours to work (possession already tight).

Whilst pulling on a clip, the puller came off the clip without the staff member realising causing him to fall, injuring his elbow and lower back. The IP attended Queen Elizabeth hospital where the injury was cleaned and bandaged. Due to a 5 hour wait to be seen, hospital staff recommended the IP attended the minor injuries unit at Stobhill which opened at 09:00. Immediate cause:- The IP lost their balance, fell and struck their elbow on the ballast while attempting to install a Pandrol e-clip. Underlying cause:- The lack of resistance when attempting to pull in the clip was unexpected by the IP  Remedial Actions:- Individual and wider TSM Glasgow North team briefed on the incident.  Underlying cause:- The IP did not adequately check that the clip was correctly seated prior to an attempt being made to install it due to being distracted by another team member.  TK49 use of Panpullers states ""before inserting a clip check that insulators are correctly seated between the rail foot and pandrol housing"". Remedial action:- IP and wider TSM team to be rebriefed on contents of TK49 and the principles of the task. TSM to initiate during assurance that the plans checked have all relevant TRCS included and links are for the latest versions. Underlying cause:- Although not a specific underlying cause, Task Risk Control Sheet TK49 - Use of Panpullers / Remove Frozen Clips was not listed in the SSOWPs pack and was not briefed at the start of the shift. The omission was not picked up at the planning or verification stage. Note that a comprehensive risk assessment for working with rail was included - TK40 - however this has no reference to the use of panpullers. It is felt by the investigator that due to the volume of material within TK documents, and the volume required for any given job, it is unlikely that inclusion of TK49 in the SSOWPs pack would have led to the need to check the positioning of the pandrol being explicitly and effectively highlighted in the pre-work brief. Remedial Action:- TSM team to be made aware of TK49 and made aware of it's contents. TSM to initiate during assurance that the plans checked have all relevant TRCS included and links are for the latest versions. Glasgow DU to discuss the use of task risk control sheets as part of the Safety Improvement Group and aim to improve the use of task risk control sheets Route to assess use of TRCS in SSOWPS packs and their efficacy of use in briefings.

Immediate cause: The requirement to physically access the Dormouse boxes location within uneven footing conditions.  Underlying cause: Working within uneven footing conditions to commence the task of checking Dormouse boxes.  Comments: Methodology of the task places those undertaking at risks of slips, trips and fall due to exposure to uneven underfoot conditions.  Underlying cause: Ecologists are new to working on track and track side and developing their experience to the uneven underfoot conditions that can be present.  Comments: The work environment presents an increased risk of slips, trips and falls due to the location that the Dormouse boxes will need to be located. Often track side within vegetation.

The IP continued to work and reported the incident later that night.  The IP returned to work to his substantive duties – he was advised by his doctor that he could return to work on light duty i.e. don’t do physical work that would aggravate the injury.

Boots are in good condition with regard to protection and comply with EN ISO 20345 and S3 standard. Sought medical advice, no further damage to ankle. X-ray all clear. IP applied ice pack and tubigrip to reduce swelling has gone down. GP advised light duties if heavy work/manual etc, however this is not part of IP role, and has continued in normal job role (booking line blocks) without any time lost. Immediate cause: Slightly uneven ground on side of path. Underlying cause: Damage to ground, slight gap to grass verge. Some small growth of vegetation so gap wasn’t abundantly clear (had never been spotted by the Signallers using the path every day).

EM061. IRIS 15169.,"The Injured Person (IP), a contractor (TRAC) machine operator, injured their left ankle after slipping when working at St Albans. They completed their shift that night but did not come into work the next day as it was sore. Further investigations had revealed a hairline fracture but it was not reported as an accident until Friday 4th September 2021. Update received - IP suffered a hairline fracture on his right foot. He had returned back to work on the Thursday (02/09/2021) on light duties, He was working as a machine operator for flailing works at St Albans, on behalf of Bedford off track. Update from Incident Report and Investigation by contractors - TRAC. The IP arrived onsite prior to the official shift start time to make preparations for the Valtra tractor SV102 to get onsite. Keys for the machine had been left by the external transport company inside the cab of the machine when the machine was delivered prior to the shift. However the operator was not aware of this. This was not normal practice – normally keys were left in the secure key drop box attached to the machine.  The machine had been parked at the access point in such a way that the only way to reach the key drop box was to climb over some sleepers. However, the IP found that the keys were not contained within the key drop box attached to the machine, rather the keys were left in the cab. On his way down from trying to find the keys, he tried to stand on a smaller piece of wood which was buried in the undergrowth, but went over his left ankle. The weather had been dry so the timber was not slippery, so it was felt that he just landed his foot at an awkward angle, causing the twist when he put his weight on. He called the On-call manager to report the incident but reported that he would be able to continue the shift as he thought at this point it was just a twist to his ankle and it wasn’t very painful. The tractor was automatic transmission so would not require significant use of his left ankle/foot so he felt he would be OK to continue working. The shift continued without further issue and the IP travelled back to his hotel (van with automatic transmission) for rest. On wakening from his suitable rest period, the ankle was more painful and more swollen so he spoke to the manager again and reported initially that he would visit a local hospital to get it assessed. However, once he got in the vehicle he changed his mind and decided to travel home to visit his local hospital. Following x-rays, the doctor diagnosed a minor lateral malleolus fracture to the left ankle. A tubi-grip strapping was applied and the IP was issued with crutches, in case he required them, and told to continue to move on it gently. He was also issued with painkillers (co-codamol and naproxen). The IP only felt the need to take on the day he went to hospital (01/09) twice, thereafter he utilised ibuprofen only. The IP then went home to rest. He reported on Saturday that the ankle was no longer painful, he was able to walk on it normally and he was no longer taking any painkillers. He carried out a night shift on Saturday 04/09/21 without any problems.  The haulage company used for the delivery of the machine was a well known, regularly utilised haulage company and this was not an issue that had been experienced with them in the past. The access point at this site was quite tight but it was not clear why the machine was placed in the location it was, with restricted access to the key drop box. The change from the planned delivery practice for the keys also failed to be communicated as an update by the haulage company. The risk assessment for the machine/site did not specifically cover this as a risk, as it was not viewed as a foreseeable risk for the machine to be parked in a way that restricted access to the key drop box  Due to this incident resulting in a fracture, the incident would be reported to the HSE under RIDDOR.  CONCLUSIONS/ACTIONS  Reiterate to external transport companies that all machine keys to be placed in the keysafe box if possible. Also, to ensure that pre delivery drivers park vehicles free from obstacles wherever possible. Any change to pre agreed plans to be communicated back through on call systems if necessary.

IRIS15782,"Member of staff attempted to reinstate a portable light after it had fallen over. When doing this the ballast shoulder gave way and member of staff fell on his side, hitting rails as he fell. Ballast shoulder was retained by old rails. Initially Member of staff continued to work but felt more pain by the end of his shift. The work comprised the installation of remote monitoring to underbridge in the form of tilt monitoring sensors. The work was being carried out during night shift under line block and detonator protection arrangements. The installation of the remote monitoring was being carried out by rope access by specialist sub-contractor.  Supervision and task lighting was being carried out by Main Contractor [AMCO].  The Injured Person (IP) was tasked with ensuring the subcontractor had sufficient lighting while working on structure. Lighting equipment being used on the night comprised 2 x tripod lights supplemented with 3 x portable lights. The portable lights were being moved around as rope access operatives moved to different areas of the structure.  One of the portable lights, that had been placed on a sleeper end, had fallen down and as the IP went to stand the light up, he stood on the ballast shoulder which then gave way and he then fell onto his side. The ballast shoulder at this point is retained by old rails. When he fell, his side struck the rails as he landed. He confirmed to the site supervisor he had come to no harm and continued to complete the shift. At the end of the shift he informed the supervisor his ribs felt sore.  The following evening the IP was booked on to the same job. When attending he informed the site supervisor that he had gone to A&E. The advice from the hospital was to take painkillers and undertake some breathing exercises as there is little else can be done. After discussing his condition with the site supervisor it was agreed the IP would continue to work as normal. Immediate cause - Injured Person lost balance and fell onto 'old rail' ballast retention after ballast shoulder gave way when stood upon. Underlying cause  - The WPP/SWP/TBS does not adequately cover the task of setting up lights near to a steep slope. A verbal briefing of the site risks was given on the night including use of a site hazard map. On the Site Hazard Map, there was a steep slope identified adjacent the working area. The structure itself has handrails. Although the member of staff was briefed on the slope hazard there was no written instruction or guidance other than 'be aware' or any instruction or guidance of whether their work would be limited to the 4 foot or not. There was also no mitigation specified against a fall from height. The MOS was briefed on the steep slope at the start of the shift and was conscious of this when he lost balance and began to fall. He adjusted his fall based on the knowledge of the embankment adjacent. It was clear from contractor's accident report that the risk of the steep embankment potentially played on the MOS mind as he slipped. This is backed up by the personal statement of the MOS. There is no clear instruction within documents that working at the edge of this slope has specific mitigations. -Yes, the chosen lighting type made the stability of the light vulnerable. The ""Peli"" light is universally used for numerous applications on contractor's railway sites. There was no lux levels specified in the WPP. The Peli light 'fell over' and it hasn't been determined the cause and whether it was not stable when placed on the sleeper end.",Level,,,"Amalgamated Construction Ltd., Network Rail",Track worker - Other,Duties to maintain track or infrastructure,"Cause not known; Technical, equipment or conditions",Cause not known; Safe system of work issue; Uneven surface or small change in level,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

The IP had completed assent using rope/climbing equipment and upon reaching the top and on the level ground, slipped and landed awkwardly on his chest. SCO 49707","SCO 49707 IP working for ""Aspect 360"" on Corsham rock cutting framework. The IP had completed assent using rope/climbing equipment and upon reaching the top and on the level ground, slipped and landed awkwardly on his chest. IP had lunch and then decided to attend A&E.  This is lost time event (Riddor reported as the injury is a fracture). L1 updates: On Wednesday the 24th of November, the IP ( a Irata Level 3 rope access supervisor) was supervising and working with a group made up of himself, one Irata level 2 rope access operative and one Irata level 1 rope access operative, carrying out de-vegetation works with 2x hedge trimmers and hand tools to remove anything loose. 11:25 The IP had been using the hedge cutter to de-veg and needed to re rig his ropes to enable work on the other side of a drainage pipe. He re-rigged ensuring 2 points of contact, he carried out some light de-veg work with hedge trimmers, after that was complete he placed the cutters down so that he collect the vegetation that had fallen out of arms reach. 11:50 He started descending his way past the wall, as he was stepping down next to the wall his left foot slipped on wet muddy vegetation, he fell onto his left side on top of the corner of the breeze block base for the pipe supports, his elbow and arm landed on the top of the blocks leaving his ribs unprotected to make contact with the outside corner. The IP winded himself, sat there for 2-3 minutes to catch his breath, he then started to move around to ascertain the level of injury. The Level 2 operative heard the incident as he was on the crest and made his way to the IP, by which point the IP had got over wall to a less steep part of the embankment. The IP removed himself to the top of the crest and removed his harness, Te Level 2 operative (who is a first aider) asked the condition of the IP, questions like did you bump your head?, can you move OK? IP said he was OK and had just winded himself. 11:55 All 3 personnel walked back to the compound for lunch together, during the walk back to the compound the injury felt better and the IP was able to take full breaths and thought he was fine by that point. 12:10 He went to lunch at 12:10 with another operative , who started to drive them both to the petrol station, on route the drive was causing discomfort to the IP causing him to think he had hurt himself, so the IP got the operative to drive him to the Royal United Hospitals A+E in Bath. 12:40 They arrived at the hospital, the IP checked in with A+E. 12:52 The IP phoned his manager to inform him of what had happened and where he was, his manager then gathered the details and informed the CML Project Manager of the event at 13:16. Approx. 13:10 IP saw the triage nurse within 30 minutes and was given pain killers (Co-Codamol). Approx. 14:45 The IP then waited to see the doctor/nurse who assessed him physically and decided a CT scan was required. Approx.18:00 The IP waited for a scan, after which he was told he had broken the 3 lowest ribs on his left hand side.  Approx 20:30 IP released from A+E, the operative who dropped him off had stayed local to pick the IP up.   The IP was prescribed Co-Codamol for the pain, advised it would take 4-6 weeks for full recovery and to have a check up with his GP in 1-2 weeks. Immediate cause - The IP's left foot slipped out from under him as he descended his ropes, the floor medium that he slipped on was a mixture of wet earth, vegetation, moss and calcite build up. Due to the location of his slip his ribs made contact with the corner of a concrete wall. Underlying cause - The nature of the work, there is an increased risk of slipping when working on slopes, and given the time of year the ground is wet which also increases the potential of a slip, this is why the work is carried out by rope access personnel and because he was attached to the rope he stopped after he fell rather than falling down the embankment and suffering greater injuries. Remedial actions - All site operatives including the IP were briefed on Autumn/Winter working and driving on the 16/11/2021 by myself. Site managers / supervisors to ensure that working in these conditions is safe and any extra provision of equipment or methodology is provided. All accidents are to be reported immediately to the CML representative on site so that the golden hour can be adhered to and any further risks controlled, site managers/supervisors to brief this to everyone on site. Action for individual - To be extra careful of underfoot conditions as we go into winter. Action for Manager - NA- Take 5 on site to be mindful and verbalise risks. The IP did not report accident, until at hospital. IP originally did not realise extent of injury, so only sought treatment after pain persisted and reported at this point.  Although the behavioural chart has come out as contravention- this was not a contravention. This must be noted . The IP is on light duties and this is classed as Lost time, until he has recovered and can return to his normal range of duties. The L 1 cannot be closed, until we receive confirmation that the IP has returned to his range of normal duties.  The Team have looked at reasonably practicable measures to reduce such instances.

He was wearing full NR issue PPE including safety boots. Kingsbury Junction points are accessed via DB Cargo's entrance gate off Trinity Road. The area contains sidings leading to Kingsbury Oil Terminal. Immediately through the entrance gates is an area that contains mounds of ballast and various pieces of scrap rail however, there are also areas where vehicles can fit for parking if required. Turning immediately right through the gates is a service road that runs along the sidings to the Shunt Frame. There are also various pieces of scrap rail and mounds of ballast nearby to the service road. On arrival, the MOM turned right through the main gate and parked his NR vehicle on the left hand side of the service road that leads to the Shunt Frame. This was approximately 30 yards along the service road from the entrance gates. There were two vans in front of the MOM vehicle that belonged to the watchmen who were on site to periodically inspect the points. There were three other van parked in the vicinity of the service road and area directly ahead of the entrance gate.  The MOM clipped and scotched the failed set of points and felt a 'niggle' in both of his knees due to historical issues/injuries that caused him to have knee surgery approx. four years ago. At approximately 1700hrs the watchman asked the MOM to move his vehicle so they could depart the yard. The MOM drove along the service road up to the Shunt Frame, turned his vehicle and proceeded back to the area near the entrance gates. He parked his vehicle near to the entrance gates to prevent himself getting blocked in by anyone else. Due to the number of vehicles already parked up, this was the only place available to avoid blocking others in and preventing him being blocked in should another vehicle have turned up. Once safely parked, the MOM exited the vehicle with the intention of using the service light located on the side of the vehicle to finish paperwork related to the incident as it was dark and there was no other lighting in that area of the yard. As the MOM turned around to remove the paperwork from the van, he lost his footing on a mound of ballast in the vicinity of the van. He twisted awkwardly and dropped to his knees. At the time the MOM did not think anything of it and continued his duties as required. The following morning, his left knee had swollen up causing discomfort. As a result of this, the MOM did not get much sleep the following night and decided he would be unable to work and thus went sick. He arranged an appointment with his doctor and has since been signed off sick until 27th Jan. Over 7 days lost time confirmed. Immediate cause:- The MOM lost his balance on uneven ground due to a mound of ballast. Underlying cause:- Underfoot conditions very poor, uneven surface, pot holes, mounds of ballast and no lighting. Remedial actions:- The MOM will be advised to survey areas before parking to note any trackside features that may cause tripping hazards.

NLT (Source: DCP Level 1)HSEA 50078,"These details for the level 1 form have replaced the initial details taken form the HSEA log. At approx. 13:39 hrs on 20/02/2022 a Surveyor (IP) was walking along the Down CESS at ETN 78.1342 when a strong gust of wind caught him, causing him to lose his footing, stumble, fall to the ground and then roll towards and over the top of a culvert headwall. The IP's jacket got caught on a monitoring meter affixed to the headwall which broke his fall. The IP fell approx. 6ft down the shallow embankment. The IP landed on his head/face with his safety helmet still on. The works are part of the Network Rail (NR) civil asset management framework, delivered by the NR Works Delivery team. The works have been planned by AmcoGiffen through a reactive remit MR0327a Lakenheath Culvert received from Network Rail.  AmcoGiffen's Supervisor / First Aider attended to the IP. After an initial assessment by the First Aider the IP was assisted to walk over to the Up CESS where first aid was administered. The IP's face was muddy and he had sustained 2 cuts - one laceration across the bridge of his nose and another one to the temple near his right eye.  The cuts were cleaned and plasters applied.  After the IP had rested the work group walked back to the vans. The IP walked unaided.   In the welfare van AmcoGiffen's Supervisor/ First Aider offered the IP a warm drink. AmcoGiffen's Supervisor/ First Aider advised the IP that he needs to visit A&E. The IP did not think that A&E visit was necessary, however upon insistence of AmcoGiffen's Supervisor he agreed. The IP declined AmcoGiffen's Supervisor offer to be driven by him to A&E and instead insisted on driving his own van, confirming that he was fit to drive. The IP's assistant travelled in the same vehicle as the IP. AmcoGiffen's Supervisor/ First Aider followed them behind.  Upon arrival at West Suffolk Hospital at Bury St Edmunds it was agreed that due to COVID restrictions and the fact that the IP was able to walk on his own that he will attend A&E by himself, whilst his assistant and AmcoGiffen's Supervisor/ First Aider remained in the car park.   Whilst in A&E the IP was examined and given a tetanus injection. A Steris strip was applied on each cut (stitches were not required). The IP was advised that he 'doesn't meet the criteria for an x-ray', that he should take painkillers and that he probably has whiplash. The IP was also advised that he will have to have his nose examined when the swelling goes down.  Following the A&E visit the IP drove to a local hotel.  On Monday 21/02/2022 IP's employer advised AmcoGiffen that the IP is at work, fixing his equipment and 'is in situ ready to survey tomorrow for you'. Additional information: 1) PPE: At the time of the accident the IP was wearing prescription glasses. These were not safety glasses. The glasses broke during the accident and are thought to have caused the cut on the bridge of IP's nose. The IP explained that he had to wear the prescription glasses when reading the instruments. The IP confirmed that he was briefed to wear safety glasses, that he had safety glasses with him to be worn when not reading the instruments, however at the time of the accident he wore his prescription, rather than safety glasses despite only walking on site at the time. The wearing of incorrect glasses was not challenged by AmcoGiffen Supervisor. The IP was wearing safety boots, hi-visibility clothing and a hard hat at the time of the accident. 2) PTS/TVP: The IP was working under a Track Visitor Permit (TVP) 100811907. The IP had not declared any medical conditions on the  medical declaration completed for the TVP on 18/02/2022.  3) Fatigue: Whilst Fatigue is not considered to be a factor in this incident, AmcoGiffen are currently awaiting details of IP's working hours prior to the accident so that fatigue can be reviewed. This will be added as a subsequent revision to the L1 Investigation. 4) Experience: The IP has over 30 years of experience in the construction industry, working on sites as a setting out surveyor. This was his first TVP for AmcoGiffen, and third one in recent years. The IP has stated that he had worked on Network Rail Managed Infrastructure and held PTS competence approx. 30 years ago.  Although the IP has limited recent experience of working on rail infrastructure due to the nature of his work he was often  working in similar environments.  5) COSS Briefing: The COSS briefing highlighted the risk of slip/trip and falls and high winds 6) Weather and Planning: The risk adverse weather conditions had been identified during planning stage and the controls requiring the wearing of suitable protective clothing, continuous monitoring of the working conditions by the site supervisor and making staff aware of the potential slip, trip, fall hazards were listed within the Task Briefing. AmcoGiffen's Supervisor explained that although it was windy at the start of the shift, the wind wasn't really strong and that he did not consider it was an issue at the time. It was raining lightly and a conversation was had how the rain may affect the total station; it was agreed that the team will have to come off track if the rain intensified and the total station stopped working.  Location: Culvert at ETN 78.1342 Lakenheath. Injury: Nose/above right eye, cut/laceration. Lost time? No. Immediate cause: High Winds causing IP to loose footing resulting in a fall.  Underlying cause: Adverse weather conditions. Underlying cause classification: Work environment. Remedial action: Reinforcing the change of weather conditions and potential impact on site and works (discussed with team, lessons learned to be further shared during regional SHEQ meeting on 15/03/2022). Underlying cause: Concerns regarding the weather were not made clear to the AmcoGiffen Supervisor by the IP  Underlying cause classification: Communications. Remedial action: IP was reminded that everyone has the right to raise concerns and stop works if unsafe (completed 28/02/2022)  Encourage and support IP & staff to speak up when they feel that hazards and risks are not mitigated to an acceptable level and/or if they have any concerns, regardless of impact on productivity.

The location and surroundings was around 2201 Switch Diamonds at 2m 1191yds on ELR STY. The IP was operating a Robel from the 4ft, tamping the 4ft crib, before stepping over the running rail to continue robelling from the 6ft. As the IP placed his foot on the head of the rail to step across, the IP bared weight through his left leg. The IP's foot slipped off the head of the rail and subsequently fell over into the 6ft onto the ballast shoulder. Initially the IP had picked himself up quickly and tried to walk/ hop/ bounce it off. However the COSS witnessed the incident and advised the IP to stand down from duties. The COSS sat the IP on a tonne bag of ballast that was in the cess on site and the designated first aider administered an assessment who decided to keep the leg elevated. Unfortunately, this made no impact on the pain the IP was feeling so two permanent way staff assisted the IP back to the Styal Road access ramp and then a team member drove the IP back to the Depot.  The on call Supervisor called the IP at 03:11am. The IP was back at Piccadilly Depot collecting his personal items and then a team member was dropping the IP at home, from where the IP's partner agreed to take him to A&E. It was the IPs wishes to be taken home with his belongings and to attend his local A&E with his partner. The IP said he was ok in himself but was in a fair bit of pain. On Call supervisor agreed for him to go to A&E with his partner, with no immediate golden hour risks identified. The IP thought he had dislocated his knee as he slipped and it’s re-located during the fall or when he’s jumped up. The IP confirmed he had been to A&E and had a scan. The x-ray scan showed no fractures but the doctor said it was very possible that there was ligament damage. The doctor advised an MRI scan was required.  This occurred on 12/04/2022 with an outpatients appointment to discuss the scan on 14/04/2022. Supervisor had a catch up call with IP ahead of scan, swelling was easing and IP had been for some light walks to get movement into the joint as advised by the doctor. IP sounded in high spirits and hopeful of no ligament damage but that would be determined by the scan. The IP requested to take Annual Leave rather than sick as they had two weeks off in the following week. Supervisor advised the IP that they should not do so but the IP's wishes were to utilise annual leave so this was granted. Annual Leave commenced on rostered shift 09/04/2022 to 26/04/2022 returning to work 27/04/2022. Immediate cause: Standing on the rail head where his foot slipped causing the IP to fall and twist his knee. Underlying cause: Complacency from being on site so frequently, using bad practice stepping on the head of the rail instead of stepping over ballast to ballast as per best practice. Remedial action: Manager to brief all staff the importance of not standing on the rail or sleepers and mandate that this is in every COSS briefing.",Level,,,Network Rail,Track worker - Other,Duties to maintain track or infrastructure,Actions or behaviours of people; Cause not known,Cause not known; Person in wrong place,0.01,Workforce (on-duty): Severe 7

At this point the PO realised he had left the Det-Com radios in the cab. To retrieve them the PO stood on the bottom step of the access ladder to reach into the cab. At this point the step gave way causing him to fall back to ground level (around 600mm) while catching his stomach on the side of the cab as he fell. This resulted in minor grazing and bruising to his stomach. The PO considered the injury to be minor as to not wanting any medical assistance. The PO also failed to notify their supervisor of the event until the following day so there was a subsequent delay in the reporting of the incident. Following the reporting of the event a 'Fast Facts' document was produced and circulated within JMS and Network Rail. Immediate cause - Defective step used to access the cab of the RRV.

Project - 161335 / SCO 50564 IRIS 20776","Project - 161335 SCO 50564 The IP (CD MOS - Ground Control MOS) whilst walking back to a position of safety for a line block to be given back tripped and whilst falling sustained an injury to his knee. The IP suffered a dislocated knee, and an ambulance was called and they were taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital. Staff Accident Capital Delivery – Ground Force Employee. Incident summary:  On 27 May 2022 Ground Control field team (sub-contractor) were egressing site following the completion of work on the  Network Rail infrastructure, for Western WD on project 161335. A line blockage was in place to pass a limited clearance over bridge. Once operatives had passed the limited clearance, they were instructed by the COSS to move to a position of safety in the cess to hand back the line blockage.The IP stumbled/slipped on the ballast shoulder, causing a dislocation to his left knee. The IP was treated by paramedic on site who reset the knee and walked off site to attend hospital via car. The IP will be assessed before returning to work on rail/ballast.    Detail: Team arrived at Trevingey Crossing for access and egress to site (MLN4 310M40CH Downside) between 07:40 and 07:50 on Friday 27th May 2022. The other members of the work group prepared the kit for the days work. The COSS then briefed the team on the access, SSOW, hazards, and personnel. The team accessed the site of work under a Separated Site of Work with a Site Warden in the cess. The team reached the site of work at 08:30 at which point COSS completed the POWRA adding in the additional information at the point of works. The works for the day was to complete preparation works, removing only bramble and small understorey to later return under possession to complete the chipping works. All works were to take place under line blockage protection. The first line blockage was taken at 09:23 of the Down Main between R27 and R37 from Roskear Signal Box. The works took place between 310M 75CH and 311M 16CH which is the mileage of the exit signal meaning the team could only work to this limit. The works were completed at Approx. 11:55 and the team began to egress under a line blockage to pass through the limited clearance bridge on route and then step into the cess and a position of safety to hand the line blockage back. IP was carrying a chainsaw only when he stumbled/slipped on the ballast twisting his knee resulting in a dislocation at 12:05. The team first thought that IP was suffering with cramp but soon realized that he was in real discomfort and moved him to a position of safety being over 3 meters from the running rails (Lineside). Once this movement was complete, COSS handed back the line blockage at 12:10. At 12:13 GC Senior Manager received a phone call detailing the injury, Senior Manager r was only ten minutes from the site so asked to team to make sure IP was safe. Senior Manager arrived at site shortly afterwards and started the Golden Hour process. IP was sick and in great pain so a paramedic was called and used what 3 words to locate the adjacent bridge to save time for the Paramedic accessing site. Two operatives then cleared an area of bramble and set up a two rope system to assist the Paramedic. The boundary was left intact. The Paramedic arrived at site at approx. 12:45. He was then supervised by COSS during the visit and briefed on his limits being Lineside only. The IP was then given gas and air to relieve the pain. Once this had taken effect, the Paramedic popped his knee back into place and strapped it. IP was then able to stand and hold his own weight with minimal pain. COSS then arranged a line blockage so that IP could walk out on the flat rather than uneven cess. Line blockage was taken at 13:49 and handed back once clear at 14:07. Liam was wearing Haix Protector Ultra boots at an age of approx. 4 months and in good condition. The Paramedic then met IP at the access point to ensure he was ok. He suggested going to hospital to have a precautionary scan to ensure no lasting damage was caused. IP's mother met him at the access point and took him to have the scan. Once the scan was complete, it revealed no lasting damage was caused. The advice given was to wear a supporting strap for a period of two weeks and seek physio advice shortly afterwards. IP was not signed off from work, but due to the nature of his work, IP is resting and will return to light duties soon (date TBC). IP will be assessed before returning to work on rail/ballast. The team had worked four days in a row prior to the injury. Their working hours are generally 07:00 to 16:30 (Including travel). Travel time to and from site is between 30 and 45 minutes traffic depending. The team had the weekend prior to the injury off as rest days. Immediate cause - Suspected that uneven footing of ballast shoulder /CESS caused the IP to stumble and dislocate knee Underlying cause - Condition of CESS/ballasted environment caused uneven footing (although there was no obvious hazard at this site, which was representative of standard walking conditions in a general railway environment). Remedial actions - Network Rail to provide safe CESS walkway whenever practicable. Unsafe act - Stumble/fall Was the action deliberate - No. Operative was working safely in line with the planned SSOW and was trained and competent to under take the work. Injury took place whilst egressing from site as planned works had been completed. Informed about procedures - Yes. COSS briefed team to move to position of safety once past the limited clearance bridge to enable hand back of line blockage. Procedures clear & workable - Yes. Trained and competent operative.

The IP was acting as COSS and was looking up and down focusing on where he was walking and making sure he and his colleague stayed within safe limits as the adjacent lines where open to traffic. As the IP was walking towards 420 points he tripped on the edge of a exposed sleeper on a low patch of ballast and fell to the ground around the area of the joints. At the time the IP fell he was only carrying a can of Interflon spray while acting as COSS. The type of boots worn on the day were the Steitz Secura with laces and were in a suitable condition. The IP confirmed both his boots were fully tightened at the time he stumbled and fell to the ground. When the IP first got to his feet he could feel some pain and discomfort in his right foot but it wasn't sore enough to stop him from carrying on with his duties and he continued to walk towards 420 points.  The IP greased 420 points as planned before making his way back to the egress point at Rochdale Station walking in the 4 foot of platform 2. Once at the van, the team travelled around to the Milnrow Road access point to compete the second job of the day, which would involve some cutting back of vegetation along the drivers walking route within the turnback sidings at Rochdale. The IP was the passenger as he doesn't drive. When they arrived at the access point, the pain in the IPs right foot had become much worse. The IP tried to make his way to site but the pain was too much and he had to sit down. They contacted the supervisor to inform him of what had happened. The Supervisor asked if the IP would like to be taken to the hospital but the IP didn't feel like he needed to at the time. The IP received first aid on site from a competent member of staff who applied a bandage to his right foot and ankle to try and give some support before they returned back to the van and travel back to the depot at Deal Street. Once at Deal Street, the IP still didn't feel like he needed to go to the hospital and thought some rest and ice would be enough. The IP was then driven home so he could rest.  At 15:30 the IP attended Salford Royal A&E and was given an X-ray.  He was advised that he may have 2 fractures to his metatarsal bones but the examiner would be asking for a second opinion as she wasn't 100% sure. The IP was contacted at 12:59 on the 08/06/2022 by the hospital who informed him he had one small fracture in his metatarsal bone as well as ligament and soft tissue damage in his right foot.

This was the previous arrangement several years ago before lighting was installed. Chargeman was walking back from ground frame to up platform (P2) and scanning the ground several feet in front of him. However he caught his foot on something immediately below his feet that the torch hadn't picked up and fell, hitting his left side and head.

No first aid was given, and no hospital visit was required. IP has since returned home and rested post night shift.  IP happy to attend work again and will continue to monitor for any deterioration. Immediate cause - The poor condition of the handrail at the access point was the root cause of the incident. Underlying cause - Lack of maintenance to handrail system. Upon day time visit by RM, it was determined that the overall condition of the access steps were well below standard. Multiple loose and detached fixings were observed and insufficient sections on landings which poses a fall from height risk. The lower section which became detached as the IP attempted to grab the handrail to egress from site was noted in the cess. The shear gradient of the access steps was also a concern as any loss of footing could lead to an individual falling down towards track level. The access point should be graded with the surrounding embankment parallel to the track to provide a safer means of access down to track level. Hazard tape was installed on the loose sections of handrail system by RM on site visit and findings reported to Derby Control centre.

No time lost anticipated.,"Details copied from IRIS report: This accident happened on Tuesday 22 Nov 2022 at approx. 02:15 hours on a Wessex Works Delivery S&T Outer site.  The work that was being carried out was for the RAM Signals team that had identified that selected Degraded Wire Replacement is to be renewed on the Wessex Route.  The Injured Person (IP) arrived at Wessex Works Delivery S&T Outer depot in Eastleigh to start his shift at 22:30hrs on Monday 21 Nov 2022, from here after being briefed and collecting stores and equipment for the work he and other members of the group drove to the site at Romsey station. Once the IP was at the site with the others, they were waiting for permission to access the site and carry out the work, once work started at approximately 01:15hrs on the morning of Tuesday 22 November 2022, the IP and other S&T staff were tasked to pull a 48-core cable approximately 500 meters from a relay room to RO14 (Location Cabinet) on the RTJ2 line. The IP was the last person in the line for pulling the cable and it was resting on his right shoulder, during this pull there was some slack cable that had accumulated behind the IP’s position which was becoming heavy for the IP.  6 Hour Update; IP drove home ok, no ice pack had been used on the area, but had been suggested, he advised that he was likely to take Ibuprofen before going to bed. Quick review of the events surrounding what happened, and it all followed as per the report form. He was the PIC. His boots were fully laced up. Unfortunately, he was already off site when the injury was reported, so no photos of the site, or confirmation of the boots laced up. Not expected to visit a GP or hospital for this injury. He is not expecting to have any time off work with this injury and expected to be at work that evening. To reduce the weight on the right shoulder the IP lifted the cable to his left shoulder so he could let go of it, the reason he did this was if he had let the cable go whilst it was still on his right shoulder, he may have ended up falling down the bank instead, as at that time the cable was being pulled at an angle. However, whilst the IP was doing this movement, the IP’s hard hat was knocked from his head by the cable and the cable, unfortunately, landed on the IP’s left shoulder causing him to fall to the ground, as the IP fell, he landed which caused an injury to his left shoulder. The IP did not report straight away and waited until he arrived back at the depot and informed the Wessex Integrated Control Centre (WICC) of this accident, and the IP informed his supervisor of this accident too. A Golder Hour conversation was held between the IP and his supervisor at 07:00hrs on Tuesday 22 November 2022 to discuss this accident. When the IP was asked if they would do anything differently to prevent something like this from happening again the IP suggested the potential of having more staff to help pull, also not pull on an angle and have less obstruction to help with a smoother cable pull in the future.

SCO 51498,"Pod-Trak were undertaking works to install the main car park at the Headbolt Lane Project, these works involved kerb installations. Due to adverse weather conditions the ground was found to be icy in some areas. BGCL HSEQ walked around site to inspect underfoot conditions with recommendations presented to BGCL Management to temporarily cease works.  Works were temporarily suspended for all personnel with briefing sessions delivered while a meeting was held to discuss potential stopping of works due to underfoot conditions. It was then decided that works should cease until further notice due to icy underfoot conditions.  Once site had been confirmed to be suspended due to the adverse weather, a Pod-Trak operative was walking within the North East car park to collect tools to pack away. The operative then slipped on a patch of ice and fell causing a swollen hand injury. First aid treatment was offered but refused. The IP resumed duties later in the day (packing away all tools/plant) and then drove home unaided.  During investigation it was noted that 2No BGCL site team members had also slipped on ice but did not injure themselves as a result. Immediate cause: Once site had been confirmed to be suspended due to the adverse weather, a Pod-Trak operative was walking within the North East car park to collect tools to pack away. The IP then slipped on a patch of ice and fell causing a swollen hand injury. Underlying cause: Adverse weather conditions had caused ground conditions to become icy. Remedial actions: Works were suspended due to icy underfoot conditions with site teams returning to work on Thursday 15th December.

He was walking carefully on the ballast in the four foot and was emphatic that he had not jumped off the platform edge to access the track, which he had noted was icy in places. Despite this he slipped and fell injuring his face (small cut on the lower lip), right knee, left fingers, and left ankle. He rang his PICOP and informed him of the accident.  The PICOP asked if he was OK to lift the protection and he said that he was. Having done and confirmed this to the PICOP, the IP rang the SWGR on call duty manager to report the accident, although he declined the offered visit to A&E.  He then left the site. By about 11: 00 he was in some pain so decided to go to North Manchester Hospital for assessment and treatment.  He had an x-ray of his left hand and left foot, showing a fracture in the left foot.

Analysis of recorded weather data showed that at the time of the accident the air temperature in Manchester was about 1oC.

He was not encumbered by any PLBs or other equipment at the time. His contract of employment is with Payme. Immediate cause:  Slipped on ice that had formed on the track.

A member of contract staff working for Morgan Sindall, was collecting marker boards at 03:30 09/01/23 at 204m 53c at Dawlish Warren, when he stepped on a wooden sleeper, slipped and ended up injuring his wrist. Nothing was said at the time, but when he arrived for duty the following night, limping, he then confirmed the accident. After attending A&E, it was found that he had 2 x broken bones in his left wrist. Only reported today (16/01/23) after an internal Morgan Sindall investigation. SCO updates: A member of the directly employed Morgan Sindall COSS team arrived in to the Parsons Tunnel main site office on the night of Tuesday 10th January limping, and claimed to have fallen over on track near Dawlish Warren the previous night whilst collecting the marker boards. The fall resulted in a swollen ankle and two small broken bones in his wrist. The IP fell whilst walking the marker boards back to the access point after collecting them from the possession limit. The fall occurred at approximately 03:30 on the 9th January. The incident was reported to the Morgan Sindall management team on the 10th January at 17:30. The fall was a result of the individual walking on the wet, slippery sleepers rather than stepping ballast-to-ballast, as trained. Official reporting was initially delayed to determine the facts and establish whether this was a legitimate workplace injury. The lateness of reporting cast a doubt. The IPs decision not to immediately report the incident and allow us to report/ action this in the correct process will be addressed in the subsequent investigation that I will prepare next week. The statement had been taken from the IP - there appears to be no other contributory factors such as fatigue, poor lighting, poor footwear or being manually overloaded. A statement had been taken from the Morgan Sindall ES that first noticed the injury when the IP turned up in the office on the 10th. He confirmed that no immediate report was made to him on the 9th regarding the incident. The IP was off work and recovering at home having been to the hospital. His wrist had been put in plaster. The swollen ankle had recovered and the IP was now walking normally. Injured person did not immediately report the incident or feel any significant pain. IP had subsequently visited the hospital and was now in a wrist cast.

Time lost anticipated - Source: Level 1. IRIS ref 25839.,"On the 21st January at approximately 03:20 a workforce consisting off 1 x COSS and 7 Operativres undertaking Row 1 Re-railing. Access to the track was via an authorised access stairs of Sandy Lane Bridge. Whilst the weather was cold there was no reports of snow or ice affecting the safe use of the access stairs. The IP, who was also the Controller of Site Safety, (COSS), undertook the safe work briefing which included the topics of SLIPS, TRIPS and Safe use of the access stairs prior to the start of the works. A number of items required for the pending activity were to be manually taken from the top of the access point to track level and surplus materials taken from track up the access steps to the vehicles. Whilst alternative access was available, circa 2m at a Road Rail Access Point (RRAP), it was decided to use this access stairs as a quicker alternative. The incident occurred whilst carrying a large box of stressing rollers from the track up to the vehicles. It was during this activity that the IP became unsighted to the edge of the concrete steps and when placing his foot down he missed the step by placing his foot on to the edge of the step and half his foot on the uneven ground to the side. This caused the IP's ankle to overturn. A duty of care was provided by the Works Deliver (WD) Supervisor and the IP was taken to Norwich A&E for treatment. Witness Statements: No witness statements were available as there were no witnesses. However, statements were later provided by the WD Supervisor and the IP. Weather: The IP reported the stairs as icy, however, photographic evidence and statement from the WD Supervisor confirm that the stairs were free from ice/snow etc. Fatigue Score: This has been assessed using a 17 day roster and fatigue is not considered to be a factor in this incident as this falls way below the threshold of 65. Fatigue score was recorded at 29. Risk Score: This has been assessed using a 17 day roster and while above the score of 1 this falls below the threshold of 1.6. The Risk score was recorded at 1.19 Nutrition and hydration: This has been assessed and is not considered to be a factor in this incident.   Other factors: 1) Pressure to get the job done - the IP has stated that he felt under pressure to get the job done and not to be considered lazy or not a team player. The IP also states in his statement that he takes full responsibility for the incident which could have been prevented by using an alternative access/egress point further down the track (circa 2miles from the access stairs). 2) Pre-existing conditions: Medical reports provided as part of the investigation have identified that the IP incurred ankle injury whilst on holiday which required hospital treatment.  This was in 2021 and since this time the IP has recorded occurring problems with the same ankle resulting in restricted duties for a period of time while at work. This included non-track side activity. While it is not suggested that the pre-existing condition is a contributing factor, it is perhaps suggested that someone with no pre-existing condition might not have suffered a similar outcome and needing hospital treatment. 3) The Hospital reports a suspected closed fracture, however this needs to be determined following an assessment/ X-rays at the Fracture Clinic 3) Slipping: While the IP reporting slipping there is no evidence to support a slip other than the IP 'overturning' his ankle when partially stepping onto uneven ground. Location: Sandy Lane Bridge Access point Injury: Strain/sprain right ankle Lost time?  - Immediate cause: Partially stepping off a flat level surface on to uneven ground causing ankle to rotate and overturn. - Underlying cause: IP was carrying a large box and was unsighted when placing his right foot on the step causing the IP to place half their foot on the concrete step and half on uneven ground. - DCP No further investigation required",Level,,,Network Rail,,,Cause not known,Cause not known,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

Lost time? 3-7 days (Source: IRIS report). 5 days lost, returned to duties 01/02/2023. IMMEDIATE CAUSE The IP whilst walking along a sloped area slipped on the icy underfoot conditions and fell into a plastic water barrier, causing the injury UNDERLYING CAUSE#1 The route the IP took was along a route that had been previously constructed of Type 1 stone. This construction method naturally negated the potential for ice build up. But, over a period of time due to passing traffic the stone had become more compacted. Water had gathered in areas which had been previously clear, this water then had frozen overnight. The IP did not expect to encounter the icy conditions along the route he had taken. Other areas around the worksite had been assessed and rock salt spread to mitigate the risk of a person slipping in the condition UNDERLYING CAUSE CLASSIFICATION#1 Work Environment REMEDIAL ACTION#1 The area where the ice was present has been treated with rock salt.  The temporary works supervisor is to check any made up roads and tracks daily for any signs of deterioration and ice build up, this is to be be reported to site management and correct actions taken to rectify problems. When temperatures are due to go below freezing rock salt to be deployed at high traffic areas the night before. UNDERLYING CAUSE #2 Failure in timely and accurate communications back to Network Rail. UNDERLYING CAUSE CLASSIFICATION#2 Communication REMEDIAL ACTION#2 There was a failure to communicate changes in the IP's situation back to Network Rail. We are looking into this internally and have had a meeting (06/02/2023) between senior management and project management to unpick the reasons why reporting was not as fluid as it should have been. We are now looking into digital reminders from our time sheet system which would alert project management to absences and remind them to report accordingly. We are also developing the lessons learnt from this into a safety brief which will be cascaded company wide to ensure timely and robust communication and reports in future. BEHAVIOURAL CAUSE AND ACTIONS UNSAFE ACT The IP whilst walking through the worksite slipped on a section of icy underfoot conditions.  WAS ACTION DELIBERATE - NO The route the IP had taken had not, due to the construction of the route had any previous issues with build up of icy conditions. INFORMED ABOUT PROCEDURES - YES A Toolbox talk had recently been undertaken regarding the care required whilst working in conditions associated with winter working and cold weather conditions.

No absence from work was anticipated, however the member of staff was awaiting a call back from the doctors as there may be a possible fracture. S&T team of 3 staff attended site at Great Yarmouth to complete points maintenance as per DAP block COL352. The team arrived at site at approximately 08:45.  At 09:35, the Signaller contacted the COSS and requested he give up the line blockage as he believed a possession irregularity had occurred. The IP said that the COSS was visibly concerned after the call and instructed the team to make sure tools were removed and staff returned to the access point so that the COSS could give up the line blockage.  The IP said that due to the potential irregularity and perceived urgency to get off track, they were rushing back along the cess to the access point. The IP said that he was not paying attention and as they were leaving site, he tripped on scrap rail in the cess which caused him to twist his foot awkwardly and injure his toe. The IP did not report the incident at the time as was more concerned about him and his team getting clear of the site. They were met by the MOM and taken back to the office more medi screening.  Overnight, the IP was in some discomfort and developed some bruising on his toe. He made an appointment to get the toe x rayed the following day and made his line manager aware. His line manager advised he need to report the incident. It was then reported (24 hours later) to fault control.  The IP had no broken bones, but some minor tendon damage, likely to have been sustained by the pull of the toe in his boot.  The IP was interviewed and he confirmed that he was wearing full PPE including sufficient boots that are well fitting and in good condition. The event resulted in no lost time and the IP is fit and well.  Immediate report - IP was rushing to get to the access point and into a position of safety so that the line blockage could be handed back due to an alleged line blockage irregulairty and in his haste, caught his foot on a bit of scrap rail in the cess causing him to twist his foot and pull the tendons in his bog toe (left fot) Please note the IP was wearing appropriate PPE.  Underlying report - Cess which is commonly used as the safest walking route was obstructed by scrap rail which the IP tripped over when egressing site at haste  Remedial actions - TME norwich is currently looking into launching a 'tidy rail' campaign whereby resource will be attained to identify and remove scrap rail where this causes a safety or security risk as priority.  IP will take extra care and be careful to avoid obstructions and report these via the close call process.

At the end of his shift the pain had become greater and the IP decided to drive back home to Stafford and call in his local hospital there.  The IP on attending Samuel Johnson Community Hospital, Lichfield was x-rayed and informed the ankle was sprained and had sustained some ligament damage and was discharged. IP returned to work (in an office) on his next shift. The access and work area were well lit.  The access point was in good condition with good underfoot conditions and a concrete apron on the approach to the track. The position where the IP fell was located on the concrete apron where there were a scattering of stones present on its surface. The IP's boots were inspected and found to be in satisfactory condition with no significant defects.  The IP's boots were not laced up securely and this resulted in them being loose fitting which, offered little support to his ankles when walking.  In the photograph taken, the boots can clearly be seen as laced to the top eyelet ring but the top 3 lace hooks were not engaged with the laces and the laces loosely pushed inside the boots.

Whilst descending the second set of three sets of steps, the IP stated he missed the step with his leading foot causing him to fall backwards but as he was holding the handrail this pulled him over to his right side causing him to bang his knee and graze his elbow. All PPE was correctly worn with full tied high top boots. Immediate cause: Loss of footing / poor foot placement Underlying cause: On investigate and discussions with other colleagues and supervisors, this does not appear to be the first time the IP has fallen recently, although previous occurrences haven't been reported. On speaking to the IP this seems to be an issue with how high he lifts his feet when walking. Unknown if this is an on-going medical condition, so an OH referral has been arranged.

Whilst stepping into a position of safety to hand back a line block, the IP stood on a piece of ballast which gave way under his foot.

The grounds around the LOC have had a brand-new hard standing created for S&C to be built on it. So whilst trying to get to the location (011.028), there were other people on site and the IP and the COSS were walking and talking to them and as they were walking towards the LOC the IP turned round and didn’t see the edge of the newly created ballast bank which had been created after some capital delivery renewals work which had left has at least a 4ft hole/void going down into the LOC, then the IP then slipped down the ballast in to the hole which is roughly 4ft deep. As the COSS was still talking, he heard the IP call out in pain but hadn’t seen him fall into the hole, the COSS helped the IP out of the hole by pulling him up by hand as the climb out was too steep especially as the IP had injured himself during the fall which along with his medical condition of Spondylitis and couldn’t pull himself out of the newly created ballast bank as the IP had jarred his back. Once the IP had got out of the hole the COSS helped him back to the van as he wasn’t walking very well, the COSS asked if he wanted to go to hospital which the IP declined so the COSS took him back to the depot and then offered him a lift back home to which he also declined and got the train home back to Southend on sea.

No first aid was required and they felt no pain at the time.  The following morning they were slightly limping and feeling some pain. No hospital was required and no time off work was required with the condition being monitored by the IP. Immediate Cause - Misaligned step, which had a shorter tread length than the previous step caused the IP to misjudge the placement of his foot.  Underlying Cause - The steps at Hinton Admiral were constructed by NR from materials that are not designed to be used as a stairway (concrete troughing). As a result, the step riser/tread dimensions are not consistent along the length of the stairway. The variations in  dimensions increase the likelihood of trips on the stairway.  Steps have also deteriorated over time and have shifted from their  installed positions. Several steps have become misaligned as a result. The individual was familiar with the condition of the steps  and had used them several times throughout the shift that day. The condition of the steps was not included within the Task  Briefing and therefore precautions were not formally briefed. Safety boots worn by the IP were in good condition. Remedial Actions - Delivery of a toolbox talk to all site personnel, specific to taking additional precautions when using the existing steps. Underlying Cause - Reliance on use of existing access steps, prior to installation of new steps that are part of the contract works. This was due to the small volume of trackside route works, which were not happening until the latter stages of the project programme. The existing steps were only planned to be used during one possession pre-install, and were not deemed high risk (as they were stable and had a handrail installed) to require replacement based on the planned usage.

IP tripped pushing a trolley at Darwen and injured knee. CD 110139,"On Sunday the 29th October at approximately 23:00 Network Rail Works Delivery were undertaking renewals works at Darwen. As part of these works 2 no. subcontract welding teams were carrying out aluminothermic welding during the shift. At about 00:10 of Monday the 30th of October, a team consisting of the IP, and 2no. of welding staff, were pushing their equipment to the work site on a type B track trolley. It had been raining, and the track conditions were wet. At approximately 00:15 on 30th October the team were pushing the trolley down a gradient towards a set of points. The IP was operating the brake handle with another operative assisting with the pushing of the trolley. The trolley had basic welding equipment placed on it and was within known weight tolerances for a type B trolley. The Controller of Site Safety (COSS) was slightly ahead of the workgroup. As the work-group and trolley were passing through the points, the IP misjudged stepping over a tie bar and caught his foot under the lip of the bar, this caused the IP to fall and hit his right knee on one of the components of the points. The IP sat on the trolley and lifted the leg of his overalls to see that he was bleeding from a cut to his knee. At this point the IP was asked if he wanted to stop works, the IP replied that he was OK and that he wanted to continue on with the shift. The IP continued, though in some pain and this injury was not reported to site supervisory staff, the incident was not raised to NR control. Later on the 30th of October, the IP notified the subcontractors On-Call Manager and Operations Manager by text to inform them that he was unable to attend work for the following week, due to the injury sustained at site becoming worse. The IP attended The Royal Blackburn Hospital A&E unit where he was examined and was told he had sprained his knee. The IP was given pain killers and told to rest. Immediate cause: A member of a subcontract welding team tripped and fell over a tie bar attached to track points whilst operating a track trolley, resulting in an injury to his knee. Underlying cause: Although not a direct contributory factor the management of fatigue including the understanding of the Fatigue Risk Indicator (FRI) by the subcontractor has been an area of concern. The scores created by the subcontractor have been found to be inaccurate, and the investigator noted a lack of understanding on obtaining a correct score when working out an individuals fatigue at the resourcing stage.  Remedial action: This issue is to be raised to the Network Rail PC licensing team to conduct an audit of GPX Engineering Ltd, in specific relation to fatigue compliance when resource planning. Underlying cause: The supervision on the shift failed to notify CD Control of the injury when it occurred. Due to the subcontractor assuming Network Rail CD Control had been notified this led to a delay in the initial reporting of the event and a missed opportunity to obtain specific evidence relating to the investigation.  Remedial action: All Work Delivery managers (WDM's) are to ensure site supervisory teams are briefed on the requirement to notify CD Control of any injuries sustained at our sites of work, however minor in compliance with health and safety legislation (HASWA 1974). Underlying cause: The individual did not take adequate care when pushing the trolley through S&C on site that is known to contain multiple slip/ trip/ fall hazards.  Remedial actions: Supervision are to include the heightened potential for STF around S&C areas in the task briefing for works and highlight potential areas of concern when utilising a track trolley. The consideration for additional site lighting must be taken when conducting duties at times of low visibility.",Unknown,,,"GPX Engineering Ltd, Network Rail",Track worker - Other,Duties to maintain track or infrastructure,Human performance factors,Tripped over own feet/missed footing,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

Immediate cause: The examiner slipped as a result of underfoot conditions of the access steps (dilapidated access steps, uneven and wet) Underlying cause:  The examiner didn't fully assess, take adequate time or appreciate potential hazards from the site access steps i.e. dilapidated access steps with the potential to cause injury from uneven and wet access steps. The Examiner was concentrating on getting the work done rather than thinking about potential hazards. Remedial actions:  All examiners are to review all access points taking into account hazards such as wet underfoot conditions, dilapidated access stairs that have the potential to cause personal injury. All Examiners must stop and take time to assess the task and safest method to access their site. Network Rail Examinations Manager to brief teams on assessing the worksite and emerging risks and hazards prior to commencement of work. Examinations Manager to produce a one page safety alert  for communication to colleagues as part of wider lessons learned.  Underlying cause:  The access steps are covered with vegetation such as brambles, grass, moss and a variety of pernicious weeds. Concrete treads and risers are also worn out due to historic use. The access point had been identified as poor from a previous visit by the Examination Team. This was identified and close called, yet the Examination team continued to use the steps.  Remedial actions:  Access points identified as inadequate to be reported to the asset owner direct for remedial action.

An RRV man-rider went to site to pick him up and take him back to the Site Access Control for first aid before onward travel to hospital for x-ray. He was diagnosed as having a broken tibia and fibula.  Primary sponsor for the contractor was CRS.  During a CRSA Core renewal week 44 a CRS track operative stumbled and caught his foot on the running rail. The stumble resulted in the IP sustaining two fractures to the tibia, and one to the fibula The IP accessed at Chinley East Access Point and was walking towards the worksite within the tunnel. Due to new rails stored in the four-foot the IP was walking in the Cess. There was also scrap rail stored in the Cess, this was against the tunnel wall. The IP stepped from the Cess into the four-foot. At this point he when he lost his footing and stumbled with his foot getting caught on the running rail. The team managed to get the IP onto the people carrier to take him back to the access point at Edale Station. All movements around the IP were stopped once the CRSA Supervisor was made aware of the situation. The Supervisor requested the Road Rail Vehicle (RRV) with People Carrier attachment to egress the IP out the Tunnel which was the approved method for staff to travel in and out the Tunnel. The IP was then taken to Liverpool Hospital by another member of CRS staff in a company vehicle. The IP stated an ambulance would take a long time and want to go straight to hospital. The IP was then transferred to the Wrexham Maelor Hospital for surgery nearer to the IP home address. The CRSA Supervisor briefed his remaining staff within that area on slips trips and falls, site surroundings, not to step on rails, and to walk ballast to ballast. Immediate cause:  The IP lost his footing, caught his foot on the running rail and then stumbled on the wet ballast, resulting in fractures in 3 places on his lower left leg. Underlying cause:  Numerous additional tripping hazards caused by scrap rail not removed by the DU prior to the works starting. No additional mitigation considered when the DU declined to clear the scrap rail Momentary loss of situational awareness – IP stepped over a rail and lost his footing on the ballast Site specific risks were not briefed, only generic references to underfoot conditions.

This  is the correct standard practice. The IP used his left arm to break his fall and in doing so injured his wrist. The IP and the first aider did not  realise the severity of the injury and he decided to continued to work until the end of the shift. It was at this point and due to the increased level of pain that the IP was experiencing, the first aider on site realised that he would have to attend hospital for an Xray to assess if the injury was more sever than he originally thought. The IP was taken to hospital and an x-ray was carried out which found that he had fractured his left wrist.

It was at this point that the pain had increased and first aid was given and the IP was taken to hospital by a member of the team. The IP was X-rayed in hospital and it was identified that he had fractured his wrist. Immediate cause: The IP has not ensured that he had the correct stance, with both feet firmly positioned on the ballast, along with his balance and posture being correct to adjust his body weight accordingly when the Pan puller hook has slipped from the Pandrol.

CD 110353","North West & Central (WCS) – CCIL 2851607 At 0745, a member of staff, employed by Terraferna, fell to the ground, landing on their shoulder at Church Lawford as a result of a handrail on a lorry failing and coming off.  IP was climbing up the ladder on the side of the lorry to operate the device on the lorry, he grabbed the handrail on the ladders and having got half way up the ladder the handrail came off and the IP fell back to the ground landing on his shoulder, causing pain, they received First Aid at the scene and proceeded to attend hospital. for assessment and treatment. Over 7 days lost time confirmed. Additional information from Level 1 form as follows:-  On the 3rd May at 06:00 a subcontractor team comprising of a crane operator (IP), driver and crew man arrived at the Church Lawford Project Compound on Coronation Road to undertake removal of Terrafirma matting panels. The panels had been previously installed, without incident, by the subcontractor to allow for the plant required for the projects drainage installation works to travel safely to the work area.  The subcontractor team had been inducted the previous day. They signed on to the Network Rail Site Attendance sheet and the crane operator completed the subcontractor POWRA briefing and the team proceeded to begin with their planned works in the work area adjacent to the main compound area. The panel removal works involved the use of a flat bed wagon with a crane inbuilt which would lift the panels to load on to the back of the flatbed via a remote control function and then be transferred to an artic wagon within the compound laydown area and transported off site by road. The operator was to position themselves in the ""high seat"" located at the rear of the wagon which is accessed via a set of steps on to a platform area where the seat can be utilised. The crane operator used the high seat as opposed to operating the crane remotely from ground so they had visual of the driver and crewman during the lifting operations. The crane operator, when accessing the back of the flatbed, to reach the high seat, held on to the handrail with their left hand. They used one of the bars of the steps in an effort to maintain three points of contact and attempted to pull themselves up. As they reached for the step bar, the handrail gave way and they were swung to the left making contact with the outrigger leg, which in turn shunted their arm and  resulted in a fall to the ground. The crane operator was assisted by the crewman as during the fall their legs had become tangled within the hydraulic hoses of the flatbed wagon. Access to the high seat should have been achieved via the use of two handrails on the back of the flatbed however one was missing. Had both handrails been intact the crane operators weight would have been evenly distributed during access and they would have been able to safely maintain three points of contact. Before the crane operator left their place of rest, they digitally conducted their pre use vehicle check sheet and no defects with the vehicle were recorded. In interview the crane operator confirmed they did not believe there to be any defects with the vehicle. The wagon, upon inspection post incident, was found to have had a missing handrail, and in turn inadequate edge protection, which was not identified by the crane operator during their pre start vehicle check sheet. However, the Transport manager contradicts that the operator was unaware of the defect and states that the handrail had been reported as defective on the 19/04/2024 and was due to be repaired imminently. As an interim control measure the Transport Manager had a verbal conversation with the crane operator prohibiting the use of the access steps and instructed the operator to use the remote function from ground level to operate the crane. This instruction was not documented within the RAMS and the crane operator does not recall this conversation or instruction.  Post incident, the crane operator was driven to hospital and received a medical assessment. Initial findings are damage to the rotator cuff of their left shoulder however an MRI scan is required to determine the extent of their injuries. The crane operator is on medication and has been medically signed off from work. Immediate cause:-   The handrail the crane operator was utilising for access failed resulting in a fall from height causing injury.  Underlying cause:-  The handrail was defective as some parts were missing and other parts were in a state of disrepair which meant the protection offered was inadequate. Remedials actions:-  The vehicle is to be quarantined until the required repairs are carried out to ensure the vehicle has adequate protection in place to allow safe access/egress and prevent falls from height before it is returned in to service. Underlying cause:-  The crane operator failed to recognise that the vehicle did not provide adequate protection or that the handrail was defective during their documented pre use checks.  Remedial actions:-  The crane operator is to be briefed on the findings of this investigation and the importance of ensuring a thorough pre use check is recorded and any defects are escalated via the formal defect reporting process. Murphy have released an amber alert detailing the importance of pre use checks and quarantining any items of plant or equipment that are not safe for use. Underlying cause:-  The Transport Manager was made aware of a defect (missing handrail) on the 19/04/2024 however the vehicle was still in operation two weeks later when the accident occurred with no suitable documented control measures to ensure the defect did not have an effect on the safe operations (the RAMS did not prohibit the use of the defective area of the flatbed). Remedial actions:-  The subcontractor must demonstrate they have adopted a clear process detailing recommended timescales for any repair work to be carried out. Additionally, they must document interim control measures for any defective equipment that can safely remain operational within the relevant RAMS. Any plant or equipment that cannot be safely used with reported defects, whilst awaiting repairs must be quarantined. LSR breach  - Working at heights.

The IP also noted that the trolley was difficult to push. This has been quarantined for service since. The trolley wasn't overloaded. The original plan was to access at Hillmorton yard with a Kubota.

On Friday, November 15th, the VolkerRail HSQE Director received an email from the POD Track HSQE Director regarding an incident involving an operative who sustained a broken thumb on Sunday, November 10th.  The incident allegedly went unreported until Friday morning, when POD Track was informed by the IP’s agency. From contractor report: The injured person (IP), whilst carrying a 19kg rail jack on their shoulder, misjudged their footing and tripped on a raised trough route. The IP alleges that during the fall, the rail jack landed on their right hand, causing immediate pain and bleeding.  The IP states that they administered basic first aid on-site using antiseptic wipes and plasters. The IP expressed to Pod-Trak supervisor that they did not want to formally report the injury, describing it as a minor cut. The IP advised that while traveling home, they experienced increased swelling and numbness in their thumb, prompting a visit A&E. X-rays confirmed a broken thumb bone, requiring further evaluation by a specialist. As a result of the accident the injured person was absent from work in excess of seven days.  The incident was reported to VolkeRail five days after the event. The report also advised that the person was untrained in manual handling, hence an LSR breach (training & competence).

IRIS 40708","On the morning of the 12th November at 0930 the affected member of staff was undertaking an Individual Working Alone (IWA) earthworks evaluation and was walking the cess to review the condition of the earthwork. The staff member was well rested having stayed in a nearby hotel to manage fatigue due to their home address being more that 90 minutes from site - they travelled to site in a hire van and accessed at Cumwhinton Old Station.  While undertaking the examination the staff member unknowingly walked onto a bar style catch pit which was completely covered in ballast and vegetation and not visible to the staff member.  The staff member was in full PPE and wearing High leg chainsaw boots.  The catch pit collapsed and the staff members left leg fell into the catch pit. The staff member attempted to pull their leg out, however due to the angle of the bars they were unable to immediately remove it, they had to push their leg deeper into the catch pit and push the bars further down and remove their leg from the gap.  When the staff member returned to their vehicle they felt pain in their leg and noticed a small puncture wound that required a plaster but no further treatment. The staff member had other site visits planned for the ret of the day and was fit to undertake them. A close call was raised after the incident and it was reported to Operational Control.

The IP was levelling out some sand ready for works later on and stated he felt a bit dizzy and had an ear infection. His balance was affected, and he overbalanced and fell, hitting his left knee and his head on the ground. He has been taken to A&E by a colleague. 16/01/2025 - Info from IRIS 40721: The injured person (SISK Rail MOS) was working alone whilst carrying out a daily activity of laying and levelling a sand bed when he suddenly felt dizzy, upon standing from a crouching position. This dizziness led to a loss of balance and he fell to the ground. He sustained a small cut/ scratch to the side of his head near his right ear lobe and hurt his left knee. He reported that he had been suffering from an ear infection which could have affected his balance.  He was  taken to the welfare area, treated by a first aider and then taken to hospital as a precaution . The hospital confirmed that he had no broken bones and had not suffered concussion. He is to attend hospital in one weeks time for a follow up appointment regarding the injury to his knee. He was taken to the welfare area, treated by a first aider and then taken to hospital as a precaution . The hospital confirmed that he had no broken bones and had not suffered concussion. He is to attend hospital in one weeks time for a follow up appointment regarding the injury to his knee. He was suffering from an ear infection caused by wax blockage. .Ear infections can impact balance due to their effect on the inner ear, which is critical for maintaining equilibrium. Furthermore, the IP stated that he already had a weakness in the knee from a previous injury. This may have contributed to the severity of the fall or the inability to recover balance quickly. Following a conversation with the investigator, a behavioural cause was not identified due to this accident not being related to any behavioural issue. The incident itself was likely to be as a result of an ear infection when standing up quickly, that made the IP dizzy, and who subsequently further injured an existing injured knee, as a result of the fall.",Level,,,"Network Rail, Other, CrossCountry, Sisk Rail",,,,,0.001,Workforce (on-duty): Non-severe

IRIS 41843,"North West & Central (WCS) – CCIL 3003145 At 0215, it was reported that a contractor employed by McGinley had tripped over a running rail and injured their knee whilst off-loading a trolley at South Kenton station. They attended hospital for assessment and treatment. Update received 6/2/25 email from Control - IP has rested their knee but is still in discomfort so is attending the local hospital. They are currently en route. Absence from work is now expected but duration unknown. Euston DU workforce H+S advisor will continue to provide chain of care. No lost time confirmed. Member of staff (MoS) is a primary sponsored McGinley worker who was allocated as a multiskilled operative for the 6th February 2025 at the Stonebridge Park depot between the hours of 22:00 to 06:00. MoS was allocated via the integrated rostering software ‘Signal’ which automatically calculated fatigue and risk indices using an embedded RR446 calculator in accordance with NR/L2/OHS/003. [Fatigue: 31.8 / Risk: 1.57]. MoS was assigned as a multiskilled operative under the care, direction and supervision of the principal contractors (Network Rail). MoS was working under the direct supervision of a Network Rail Controller of Site Safety (COSS) and was in the process of unloading tools onto site and commencing to start work. Whilst unloading tools the MoS slipped on the ground, resulting in them collapsing and striking their right knee onto the ballast surface. This resulted in localised bruising and a laceration to the skin. The COSS along with another worker escorted MoS off site to a position of safety. After treating the injury by applying a bandage the MoS noticed they were still struggling to walk and was limping, as such they determined the best course of action was to attend the local Northwick Park Hospital and get checked out in case of any more serious injuries.  This accident was reported to the McGinley operational on-call at approximately 04:30 where information was gathered for a preliminary report. MoS was seen at Northwick Park Hospital, the attendings replaced the bandage and x-rayed the knee. They did not identify any broken bones and determined that the knee was likely sprained. The hospital recommended a “couple days rest with ibuprofen and ice pack”. MoS intends to attend their next planned shift on 08/02/2025 subject to declaring themselves fit to work. COSS has indicated in statement that there was adequate lighting on site. Additionally as headtorches are suitable and sufficient for the purpose of accessing and egressing the site it is reasonable for them to have been utilised in this circumstance. MoS attended their next planned shift on 8th February 2024 and has declared themselves fit to work. FACTORS CONSIDERED: Competency: PTS Expiry: 07/07/2025 Experience: MoS has been primary sponsored by McGinley since 02/11/2023 Fatigue and Risk: Fatigue and risk scores are compliant to NR/L2/OHS/003 and are below the 7-day running exceedance limits. Lighting: COSS states lighting conditions were adequate. PPE including headtorches issued to all workers Weather: Weather conditions appear to be fair and slightly chilly. No major storms or concerns raised. Immediate cause:- MoS lost footing whilst transporting tools on track Underlying and Root Cause Analysis:- Underfoot conditions on the track are inherently less stable than walking on solid surfaces. Ballast can shift and make it difficult to keep footing. Preventative Actions & Recommendations to improve SMS (prevent re-occurrence):  1.	MoS to be briefed on movement across ballast 2.	MoS to be briefed on ensuring they are not working too quickly or rushing, thereby putting themselves at risk of injury. MoS was not allocated to work on 07/02/2025 with their next working shift being 08/02/2025. As per the HSE endorsed guidance provided by the Crown Estate (HS Reporting Criteria 2021/22) a Lost Time Injury is classified as “an injury sustained at work that has resulted in the loss of productive work time in the form of absenteeism. This applies when time is lost starting from the next working day”. As MoS next working day is 08/02/2025 this does not satisfy the loss or absenteeism.
